# Phase 7: Comprehensive Rating (Investment Rating)

## Product Requirements

The Asset Profile should include a comprehensive investment rating system:
    - Add a prominent "Investment Rating" section at the top of the Asset Profile
    - Display requirements:
        - Letter grade rating (A+, A, B, C, D, D-, F) with color coding
        - Overall score (0-100) with percentile ranking
        - Rating confidence level
        - Last updated timestamp
    - Rating calculation methodology:
        - Weighted combination of all previous phase analyses:
            - Sentiment Rating (15% weight)
            - Comparative Analysis performance (20% weight)
            - Credit Risk Analysis (25% weight)
            - Asset Quality Evaluation (20% weight)
            - Operational Efficiency (20% weight)
        - Industry-specific adjustments
        - Market condition considerations
    - User experience requirements:
        - One-click access to detailed breakdown of rating components
        - Historical rating trends
        - Peer comparison of ratings within the same industry
        - Clear explanation of rating methodology and factors
    - Update frequency: Recalculate rating whenever any component analysis is updated

## Technical Requirements

Implement comprehensive investment rating system combining all previous analyses:
    - Create Lambda function for investment rating calculation
    - Rating algorithm:
        - Weighted combination of all phase analyses:
            - Sentiment Rating (15%): Use sentiment score from Phase 2
            - Comparative Analysis (20%): Use percentile rankings from Phase 3
            - Credit Risk Analysis (25%): Use inverse of bankruptcy probability from Phase 4
            - Asset Quality Evaluation (20%): Use quality score from Phase 5
            - Operational Efficiency (20%): Use efficiency indicators from Phase 6
        - Apply industry-specific adjustments and market condition factors
        - Generate letter grade mapping (A+, A, B, C, D, D-, F)
    - Calculation requirements:
        - Ensure all component analyses are available before rating calculation
        - Handle missing components with appropriate weighting adjustments
        - Calculate confidence level based on data completeness and quality
        - Include rating methodology transparency
    - API requirements:
        - Create endpoint for investment rating
        - Return letter grade, numerical score, and component breakdown
        - Include rating confidence and methodology explanation
        - Provide historical rating trends
    - Storage and caching:
        - Store comprehensive rating data with all component scores
        - Implement caching for frequently accessed ratings
        - Maintain historical rating data for trend analysis
    - Update triggers:
        - Recalculate rating whenever any component analysis is updated
        - Implement batch processing for rating updates
        - Ensure rating consistency across all assets

## Testing Requirements
