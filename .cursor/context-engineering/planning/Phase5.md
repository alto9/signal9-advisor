# Phase 5: Advanced Financial Analysis (Asset Quality Evaluation)

## Product Requirements

The Asset Profile should include comprehensive asset quality assessment:
    - Add a new "Asset Quality Analysis" section to the Asset Profile
    - Display requirements:
        - Overall quality score (1-100) with letter grade equivalent
        - Individual component scores for:
            - Depreciation pattern analysis
            - Inventory turnover efficiency
            - Accounts receivable aging
        - AI-generated analysis summary (2-3 paragraphs)
        - Trend indicators showing quality improvement or deterioration
    - Analysis components:
        - Depreciation patterns: Analyze consistency and reasonableness of depreciation methods
        - Inventory turnover: Compare to industry standards and historical performance
        - Accounts receivable: Assess collection efficiency and aging patterns
    - User experience requirements:
        - Drill-down capability to view individual component details
        - Historical quality score trends
        - Industry comparison for quality metrics
    - Update frequency: Recalculate quality assessment when new financial statements are available

## Technical Requirements

Implement comprehensive asset quality assessment system:
    - Create Lambda function for asset quality analysis
    - Analysis components:
        - Depreciation pattern analysis: Evaluate consistency and reasonableness
        - Inventory turnover analysis: Compare to industry standards
        - Accounts receivable analysis: Assess collection efficiency and aging
    - Scoring algorithm:
        - Calculate individual component scores (1-100) for each analysis area
        - Weight components based on industry and company characteristics
        - Generate overall quality score with letter grade mapping
        - Include confidence intervals for scoring accuracy
    - Data processing requirements:
        - Extract relevant metrics from stored financial statements
        - Calculate industry benchmarks for comparison
        - Generate trend analysis for quality indicators
        - Handle seasonal variations in financial data
    - API requirements:
        - Create endpoint for asset quality analysis
        - Return overall score, component scores, and detailed analysis
        - Include historical quality trends and industry comparisons
    - Storage requirements:
        - Store quality scores with calculation metadata
        - Maintain historical quality data for trend analysis
        - Index by asset ID and calculation date

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Testing
- **Component Score Calculation**: Test individual component scoring algorithms (depreciation, inventory, receivables)
- **Overall Score Algorithm**: Test weighted combination of component scores
- **Letter Grade Mapping**: Test score-to-letter-grade conversion logic
- **Industry Benchmarking**: Test industry comparison calculations
- **Trend Analysis**: Test quality trend calculation and indicator logic
- **Lambda Function Testing**: Unit tests for asset quality analysis Lambda function
- **API Endpoint Testing**: Test asset quality API endpoints with various scenarios

### Integration Testing
