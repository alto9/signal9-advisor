# Phase 3: Statistical Benchmarking (Comparative Analysis)

## Product Requirements

The Asset Profile should include comprehensive comparative analysis capabilities:
    - Add a new "Comparative Analysis" section with three tabs:
        - P/E Ratio Analysis
        - Revenue Growth Analysis  
        - Debt to Equity Analysis
    - Each tab should display:
        - A line chart showing the company's metric over time (3-year period)
        - Overlay of peer group average and percentile ranges
        - Current value with percentile ranking (e.g., "Your P/E ratio is in the 75th percentile")
        - Clear explanation of peer selection criteria
    - Peer selection requirements:
        - Use industry classification from stored Company Overview data
        - Include companies with similar market capitalization (±50% range)
        - Minimum of 5 peers, maximum of 20 peers for meaningful comparison
        - Display the list of peer companies used in the analysis
    - Data visualization requirements:
        - Interactive charts allowing users to hover for specific values
        - Color coding to highlight when the company outperforms/underperforms peers
        - Time period selector (1 year, 3 years, 5 years)
    - Update frequency: Recalculate benchmarks whenever new financial data is pollinated

## Technical Requirements

Implement statistical benchmarking system for financial metrics comparison:
    - Create Lambda function for peer selection and benchmarking calculations
    - Peer selection algorithm:
        - Query assets by industry classification from stored Company Overview data
        - Filter by market capitalization range (±50% of target company)
        - Ensure minimum 5 and maximum 20 peers for statistical significance
        - Cache peer groups to avoid recalculation
    - Benchmarking calculations:
        - Calculate P/E ratio, Revenue Growth, and Debt to Equity for target and peers
        - Generate time-series data for 3-year period (monthly/quarterly intervals)
        - Calculate percentile rankings and statistical measures
        - Store results with peer group metadata
    - Data processing requirements:
        - Handle missing data points with interpolation or exclusion
        - Validate financial data for reasonableness before calculation
        - Implement data quality checks for outlier detection
    - API requirements:
        - Create endpoints for each metric type (P/E, Revenue Growth, Debt/Equity)
        - Return time-series data for charting
        - Include peer group information and calculation metadata
    - Performance considerations:
        - Implement caching for frequently accessed benchmark data
        - Use batch processing for peer group calculations
        - Optimize database queries for time-series data retrieval

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Testing
- **Peer Selection Algorithm**: Test peer selection logic with various industry and market cap scenarios
- **Benchmarking Calculations**: Test P/E ratio, revenue growth, and debt-to-equity calculations
- **Percentile Calculations**: Test statistical percentile ranking algorithms
- **Data Validation**: Test financial data validation and outlier detection
- **Lambda Function Testing**: Unit tests for peer selection and benchmarking Lambda functions
- **API Endpoint Testing**: Test benchmarking API endpoints with various data scenarios

### Integration Testing
- **Database Integration**: Test DynamoDB operations for peer group and benchmark data storage
- **Data Processing Integration**: Test time-series data processing and interpolation
- **Caching Integration**: Test benchmark data caching and invalidation
- **API Integration**: Test benchmarking API integration with frontend components

### Test Scenarios
- Peer selection with minimum (5) and maximum (20) peer counts
- Benchmarking calculations with complete and incomplete financial data
- Percentile ranking with various data distributions
- Time-series data processing with missing data points
- Peer group caching and recalculation triggers
- Performance testing with large datasets
- Error handling for invalid financial data or insufficient peer groups
