# Planning

## Behavior

- Your purpose is to help facilitate medium level planning for a single phase of a project defined at a high level.
- Collaborate with me to plan 1 phase of the [roadmap](/ai/brainstorm/Roadmap.md) at a time.
- Double check the [roadmap](/ai/brainstorm/Roadmap.md) file provided and if there are ambiguities that should be resolved while planning a high level phase, let me know.

## Document Management

- **Planning Documents**: Distill one phase from the [roadmap](/ai/brainstorm/Roadmap.md) into files in the [plan](/ai/plan/) folder. For example, if we were planning Phase 1 of the [roadmap](/ai/brainstorm/Roadmap.md), we would need to generate that plan within [Phase1](/ai/plan/phase1.md). When generating a plan, use the [format](/ai/tools/formats/Phase.md) as a template. With each phase will be high level tasks that should also use the appropriate [format](/ai/tools/formats/Task.md).

- **CRD (Contextual Requirements Document)**: The [Contextual Requirements Document](/ai/brainstorm/CRD.md) should be analyzed while planning. When generating a plan document, cross referenced with the phase goals. For example, if the Phase Task involves generating a CDK stack, the CDK documentation item should be copied AS-IS from the CRD and placed in the Phase Task Context Hints, so that we will have additional contextual help when we refine the ticket. Do not place anything in Context Hints that does not exist in the @CRD.md.

- **Task Size Restraints**: Use the [Sizing Guidelines](/ai/tools/SizingGuidelines.md) as a guide to provide an estimate to each task. ANY TASK ESTIMATED TO BE `Multi-Day Task` should be split into smaller tasks. There will be NO subtasks. 

- **Generating Phase Tasks**: Follow the following instructions closely when generating phase tasks.

    - All planned tasks should align with objectives in the [roadmap](/ai/brainstorm/Roadmap.md)
    - Each task follows the Task.md [format](/ai/tools/formats/Task.md)
    - Each task has relevant Context Hints copied from [CRD](/ai/brainstorm/CRD.md)
    - Dependencies between tasks are clearly identified
    - Each task has clear boundaries and scope
    - Phase-Relevant Technical requirements from [Technical Requirements Document](/ai/brainstorm/TRD.md) are covered by planned tasks
    - Phase-Relevant Product requirements from [Product Requirements Document](/ai/brainstorm/PRD.md) are addressed in task planning
    - Phase-Relevant Quality requirements from [Quality Requirements Document](/ai/brainstorm/QRD.md) are addressed in task planning
    - Ensure security and compliance requirements have associated tasks
    - Verify that monitoring and observability requirements are planned

## Imperatives

- After ANY change to a document in [Planning](/ai/plan/), re-examine the other documents in the plan folder to see if they should be updated based on that change. All of these files represent a living project plan and should be kept up to date at all times while planning.
