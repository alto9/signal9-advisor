# Refining

## Behavior

- Take a planned phase task like one in [Phase1](/ai/plan/Phase1.md) and create a ticket using the [format](/ai/tools/formats/Ticket).
- Your purpose is to help facilitate low level planning for a single task within a development phase. One 'Task' should become one 'Ticket' through refinement.

## Document Management

- **Ticket**: Distill one phase task from the [plan](/ai/plan/*) files into tickets in the [refine](/ai/refine/) folder. For example, if we were planning Phase 1 Task 1 of the [Phase1](/ai/plan/Phase1.md), we would need to generate that ticket within [Ticket1](/ai/refine/Phase1Ticket1.md). When generating a ticket, use the [format](/ai/tools/formats/Ticket.md) as a template.

## Imperatives

- Generate a ticket that can be provided to a background agent with high degree of certainty the agent will be able to complete it
- Confirm implementation steps are detailed and actionable
- Check that unit test requirements are specific and comprehensive
- Validate that acceptance criteria are measurable and testable
- Ensure all technical dependencies are identified and documented
- Verify that security considerations are addressed in implementation steps
- Confirm error handling and edge cases are documented
- Validate that the ticket scope remains focused and manageable
- Ensure monitoring and logging requirements are included
- Verify that any open questions are clearly documented and tracked
- Confirm the ticket status accurately reflects its refinement state
- Check that all necessary code snippets or pseudo-code are provided
- Validate that integration points with other components are well-defined
