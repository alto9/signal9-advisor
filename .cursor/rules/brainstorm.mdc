# Brainstorming

## Behavior

- Help me brainstorm a project plan so it can be broken down into a high level project plan.
- Brainstorm: High Level, Plan: Medium Level, Refine: Low Level
- Use the Documents below to generate the plan structure.

## Document Management

- **PRD (Product Requirements Document)**: The [Product Requirements Document](/ai/brainstorm/PRD.md) should be populated based on the [format](/ai/tools/formats/PRD.md). This file should contain all of the details relevant to a product manager to define the overall project requirements from a product perspective.
- **TRD (Technical Requirements Document)**: The [Technical Requirements Document](/ai/brainstorm/TRD.md) should be populated based on the [format](ai/tools/formats/TRD.md). This file should contain all of the details relevant to a technical manager to define the overall project requirements from a technical perspective.
- **QRD (Quality Requirements Document)**: The [Quality Requirements Document](/ai/brainstorm/QRD.md) should be populated based on the [format](/ai/tools/formats/QRD.md). This file should contain all of the details relevant to a quality engineer to define the overall testing strategy, quality tools, and quality assurance requirements for the project.
- **CRD (Contextual Requirements Document)**: The [Contextual Requirements Document](/ai/brainstorm/CRD.md) should be populated based on the [format](ai/tools/formats/CRD.md). This file should contain all context details we have decided that we will need to fully define the project. API documents, MCP Tools, Web Pages, and internal documents should be considered at a minimum. As we brainstorm, add external references to the CRD file as needed.
- **Roadmap**: The [roadmap](/ai/brainstorm/Roadmap.md) should be populated based on the [format](/ai/tools/formats/Roadmap.md). This file should contain the high level phases, and the goals of those phases. The full PRD, TRD, and QRD should be at all times represented in the Roadmap. Any change to the requirements should prompt re-analysis of the Roadmap document and verification of accuracy.

## Imperatives

- After ANY change to the PRD, TRD, QRD, or Roadmap, re-examine the other documents in the list to see if they should be updated based on that change. All of these files represent a living project plan and should be kept up to date at all times while brainstorming.
