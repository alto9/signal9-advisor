# Ticket 2.6.3: Monitoring and Error Handling Integration Testing

### Estimate
1.5 hours

**Status**: Refinement Complete

#### Description
Validate CloudWatch metrics, logging functionality, and integrated error handling and retry logic in the complete system environment. This includes testing monitoring capabilities, error injection scenarios, and ensuring all exit criteria for Phase 2 are validated and confirmed.

#### Technical Details
- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. Create `tests/integration/monitoring/` directory structure
  2. Implement `CloudWatchTestSuite` class for metrics and logging validation
  3. Create `testCloudWatchMetrics()` method for metrics validation:
     - API call success rates (>98% for Alpaca, >98% for AlphaVantage)
     - Lambda function execution times (<50% of timeout)
     - Data validation success rates (>95%)
  4. Implement `testCloudWatchLogging()` method for logging validation
  5. Create `MetricsValidator` class for CloudWatch metrics validation
  6. Implement `validateMetrics(namespace: string, metricName: string, expectedValue: number): MetricsValidationResult` method
  7. Create `LoggingValidator` class for CloudWatch logging validation
  8. Implement `validateLogs(logGroupName: string, expectedLogs: string[]): LoggingValidationResult` method
  9. Implement `ErrorInjectionTestSuite` class for error handling testing
  10. Create `testAPIErrorInjection()` method for API failure scenarios
  11. Implement `testRetryLogicIntegration()` method for retry mechanism testing
  12. Create `testCircuitBreakerIntegration()` method for circuit breaker testing
  13. Implement `testDeadLetterQueueIntegration()` method for DLQ testing
  14. Add comprehensive integration tests for all monitoring and error scenarios
  15. Create final validation documentation and Phase 2 exit criteria confirmation

- **Architecture Considerations**:
  - CloudWatch metrics are validated against Phase 2 success criteria
  - Error injection tests simulate realistic failure scenarios
  - Monitoring validation ensures operational visibility
  - Error handling integration tests verify resilience mechanisms
  - Final validation confirms all Phase 2 exit criteria are met

- **Security Requirements**:
  - Test metrics don't expose sensitive operational data
  - Error injection tests don't affect production systems
  - Log validation doesn't expose sensitive information

- **Performance Requirements**:
  - Metrics validation completes within 30 seconds
  - Logging validation completes within 60 seconds
  - Error injection tests complete within 2 minutes
  - Final validation completes within 5 minutes

#### Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**:
  - Task2.6-Ticket1: End-to-End Workflow Testing and Data Flow Validation
  - Task2.6-Ticket2: Scheduled Trigger and EventBridge Testing
- **Dependent Tasks**:
  - Phase 3: Event-Driven Processing (upon successful completion)

#### Testing Requirements
- **Integration Tests**:
  - Test CloudWatch metrics accuracy and completeness
  - Test CloudWatch logging functionality and structure
  - Test error injection scenarios with API failures
  - Test retry logic integration with error scenarios
  - Test circuit breaker integration with sustained failures
  - Test dead letter queue integration with failed executions
  - Test monitoring and alerting functionality
  - Test error handling performance under failure conditions
  - Test coverage target: >90%

- **Performance Tests**:
  - Measure metrics validation performance (<30 seconds)
  - Test logging validation performance (<60 seconds)
  - Verify error injection test performance (<2 minutes)
  - Test final validation performance (<5 minutes)

- **Monitoring Validation Tests**:
  - Verify API success rates meet Phase 2 targets
  - Validate Lambda execution times within timeout limits
  - Confirm data validation success rates meet requirements
  - Test monitoring data accuracy and reliability

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] CloudWatch metrics accurately reflect function performance and data quality
  - [ ] API call success rate >98% for Alpaca and AlphaVantage
  - [ ] Lambda execution time <50% of configured timeout
  - [ ] Data validation success rate >95%
- [ ] Error handling and retry logic function correctly under failure conditions
  - [ ] Exponential backoff retry logic works correctly
  - [ ] Circuit breaker protects against sustained API failures
  - [ ] Dead letter queue captures failed executions
  - [ ] Graceful degradation allows partial processing success
- [ ] CloudWatch logging provides sufficient detail for operational troubleshooting
- [ ] Error injection tests validate resilience mechanisms
- [ ] Performance requirements met: functions complete within timeout limits
- [ ] All integration tests pass with >90% coverage
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met (metrics <30s, logging <60s, error injection <2min)
- [ ] All Phase 2 exit criteria are validated and confirmed
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Final validation documentation provides clear procedures for ongoing monitoring

#### Error Handling
- Monitoring tests gracefully handle CloudWatch service failures
- Error injection tests are properly isolated and controlled
- Validation failures provide detailed error reporting
- Test cleanup ensures no residual test data or configurations

#### Monitoring and Observability
- CloudWatch metrics validation results and accuracy
- Logging validation success rates and performance
- Error injection test execution statistics
- Error handling integration test results
- Final validation completion status and timing

#### Open Questions
- None - all monitoring and error handling testing requirements are clear

#### Notes
This task serves as the final validation gate for Phase 2. Focus on ensuring all success metrics and exit criteria are met before proceeding to Phase 3. The monitoring and error handling integration tests should provide confidence that the system is ready for production use and can handle real-world failure scenarios effectively.
