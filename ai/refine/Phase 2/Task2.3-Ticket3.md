# Ticket 2.3.3: DynamoDB Integration and Batch Write Operations

### Estimate
3 hours

**Status**: Refinement Complete

#### Description
Implement DynamoDB integration for storing filtered and validated news sentiment data, including efficient batch write operations and index support.

#### Technical Details
- **Implementation Steps:**
  1. Initialize DynamoDB client with correct configuration.
  2. Implement batch write operations for newsSentiment table (max 25 items per batch).
  3. Use news_id as PK and time_published as SK; support asset-news-index and sentiment-score-index.
  4. Implement error handling and retry logic for DynamoDB operations.
  5. Emit CloudWatch metrics for write performance and error rates.
  6. Validate data consistency and handle partial failures.

- **Dependencies:**
  - Task 2.3.2 (filtered and validated news data)
  - newsSentiment DynamoDB table operational

- **Testing Requirements:**
  - Test batch write operations with various dataset sizes
  - Test index queries for asset-news and sentiment-score
  - Test error handling and retry logic
  - Coverage >90%

- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - News sentiment data is stored efficiently in DynamoDB
  - Indexes support required queries
  - Error handling and retries work as expected
  - All unit tests pass
