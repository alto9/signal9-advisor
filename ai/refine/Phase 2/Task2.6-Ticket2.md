# Ticket 2.6.2: Scheduled Trigger and EventBridge Testing

### Estimate
1 hour

**Status**: Refinement Complete

#### Description
Test scheduled trigger functionality and EventBridge integration to ensure Monday-Saturday operations work correctly. This includes validating EventBridge rule configurations, trigger timing, and the integration between scheduled events and Lambda function execution.

#### Technical Details
- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. Create `tests/integration/scheduling/` directory structure
  2. Implement `EventBridgeTestSuite` class for scheduled trigger testing
  3. Create `testSyncAssetsSchedule()` method for daily asset sync scheduling
  4. Implement `testSyncEarningsCalendarSchedule()` method for daily earnings sync scheduling
  5. Create `testSyncNewsSentimentSchedule()` method for hourly news sync scheduling
  6. Implement `ScheduleValidator` class for schedule validation
  7. Create `validateMondayToSaturdaySchedule(ruleArn: string): ScheduleValidationResult` method
  8. Implement `TriggerTestHelper` class for EventBridge trigger testing
  9. Create `simulateScheduledTrigger(ruleName: string, eventData: any): Promise<void>` method
  10. Implement `ScheduleMonitoringValidator` class for schedule monitoring validation
  11. Create `validateScheduleExecution(ruleName: string, expectedExecutions: number): ValidationResult` method
  12. Add comprehensive integration tests for all scheduling scenarios
  13. Create schedule testing documentation and procedures

- **Architecture Considerations**:
  - EventBridge rules are tested in isolated test environment
  - Schedule validation ensures Monday-Saturday restrictions are enforced
  - Trigger simulation uses realistic event data structures
  - Schedule monitoring validates execution frequency and timing
  - Integration tests verify Lambda function response to scheduled triggers

- **Security Requirements**:
  - Test EventBridge rules don't interfere with production schedules
  - Test event data doesn't contain sensitive information
  - Schedule testing is isolated from production environment

- **Performance Requirements**:
  - Schedule validation completes within 10 seconds
  - Trigger simulation completes within 5 seconds
  - Schedule monitoring validation completes within 30 seconds

#### Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**:
  - Phase 1 infrastructure operational (EventBridge configured)
  - Task2.6-Ticket1: End-to-End Workflow Testing and Data Flow Validation
- **Dependent Tickets**:
  - Task2.6-Ticket3: Monitoring and Error Handling Integration Testing

#### Testing Requirements
- **Integration Tests**:
  - Test SyncAssets daily schedule (Monday-Saturday)
  - Test SyncEarningsCalendar daily schedule (Monday-Saturday)
  - Test SyncNewsSentiment hourly schedule (Monday-Saturday)
  - Validate EventBridge rule configurations
  - Test trigger event data structure and content
  - Test Lambda function response to scheduled triggers
  - Test schedule execution monitoring and validation
  - Test edge cases: Sunday scheduling (should not trigger), timezone handling
  - Test coverage target: >90%

- **Performance Tests**:
  - Measure schedule validation performance (<10 seconds)
  - Test trigger simulation performance (<5 seconds)
  - Verify schedule monitoring performance (<30 seconds)

- **Schedule Validation Tests**:
  - Verify Monday-Saturday restrictions are enforced
  - Test timezone handling and daylight saving time
  - Validate schedule execution frequency and timing
  - Test schedule rule configuration accuracy

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] EventBridge scheduled triggers work correctly with Monday-Saturday restrictions
  - [ ] SyncAssets triggers daily on Monday-Saturday
  - [ ] SyncEarningsCalendar triggers daily on Monday-Saturday
  - [ ] SyncNewsSentiment triggers hourly on Monday-Saturday
- [ ] Sunday scheduling is properly blocked (no triggers)
- [ ] EventBridge rule configurations are correct and validated
- [ ] Trigger event data structure matches expected format
- [ ] Lambda functions respond correctly to scheduled triggers
- [ ] Schedule execution monitoring provides accurate metrics
- [ ] All integration tests pass with >90% coverage
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met (validation <10s, simulation <5s, monitoring <30s)
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Schedule testing documentation provides clear procedures

#### Error Handling
- Schedule testing gracefully handles EventBridge service failures
- Invalid schedule configurations are detected and reported
- Trigger simulation failures are properly logged and handled
- Test cleanup ensures no residual test schedules

#### Monitoring and Observability
- Schedule execution frequency and timing metrics
- EventBridge rule configuration validation results
- Trigger simulation success rates and performance
- Schedule monitoring accuracy and reliability
- Timezone handling validation results

#### Open Questions
- None - all scheduling testing requirements are clear

#### Notes
Focus on creating comprehensive schedule testing that validates the Monday-Saturday operational requirements. The tests should verify that scheduled triggers work correctly while ensuring that Sunday operations are properly blocked. Consider timezone handling and daylight saving time transitions in the testing approach.
