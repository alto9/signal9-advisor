# Ticket 2.5.2: Circuit Breaker Pattern Implementation

### Estimate
2 hours

**Status**: Refinement Complete

#### Description
Implement circuit breaker patterns for external API protection that can prevent cascading failures and provide graceful degradation during sustained API outages. This includes circuit breaker state management, failure threshold monitoring, and automatic recovery mechanisms.

#### Technical Details
- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. Create `src/error-handling/circuit-breaker/` directory structure
  2. Implement `CircuitBreakerState` enum (CLOSED, OPEN, HALF_OPEN)
  3. Create `CircuitBreakerConfig` interface with configurable parameters:
     - failureThreshold: number (20% error rate)
     - timeoutWindow: number (5 minutes)
     - recoveryTimeout: number (30 seconds)
     - minimumRequestCount: number (10 requests)
  4. Implement `CircuitBreaker` class with state management
  5. Create `execute<T>(operation: () => Promise<T>): Promise<T>` method
  6. Implement `CircuitBreakerStateManager` class for state transitions
  7. Create `updateState(success: boolean, timestamp: number): void` method
  8. Implement `CircuitBreakerMetrics` class for failure rate tracking
  9. Create `calculateFailureRate(): number` method
  10. Implement `CircuitBreakerLogger` class for state change logging
  11. Create `logStateTransition(from: CircuitBreakerState, to: CircuitBreakerState): void` method
  12. Add comprehensive unit tests for all circuit breaker scenarios
  13. Create circuit breaker utilities for Lambda function integration

- **Architecture Considerations**:
  - Circuit breaker state is managed per API endpoint
  - Failure rate calculation uses sliding window approach
  - State transitions are atomic and thread-safe
  - Recovery mechanism allows gradual service restoration
  - Circuit breaker provides fallback mechanisms for degraded operation

- **Security Requirements**:
  - Circuit breaker state doesn't expose sensitive API information
  - Failure rate calculations prevent manipulation attacks
  - State transitions are logged securely without sensitive data

- **Performance Requirements**:
  - Circuit breaker adds <5ms overhead to successful operations
  - State transitions complete in <1ms
  - Failure rate calculations complete in <1ms
  - Memory usage remains constant regardless of request volume

#### Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**:
  - Task2.5-Ticket1: Exponential Backoff Retry Logic Implementation
- **Dependent Tickets**:
  - Task2.5-Ticket4: Lambda Integration Utilities

#### Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**:
  - Test circuit breaker state transitions (CLOSED → OPEN → HALF_OPEN → CLOSED)
  - Test failure threshold calculation with various error rates
  - Test timeout window management and sliding window calculations
  - Test recovery timeout behavior and automatic recovery
  - Test minimum request count enforcement
  - Test circuit breaker execution with successful/failed operations
  - Test state manager thread safety and atomic operations
  - Test metrics calculation accuracy and performance
  - Test edge cases: no requests, all failures, rapid state changes
  - Test coverage target: >95%

- **Integration Tests**:
  - Test circuit breaker with mocked API operations
  - Verify circuit breaker behavior with sustained failure conditions
  - Test Lambda function integration patterns

- **Performance Tests**:
  - Measure circuit breaker overhead (<5ms for successful operations)
  - Test state transition performance (<1ms per transition)
  - Test failure rate calculation performance (<1ms per calculation)
  - Verify memory usage remains constant

- **Security Tests**:
  - Test circuit breaker state security (no sensitive data exposure)
  - Verify failure rate calculation integrity
  - Test state transition logging security

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Circuit breaker effectively protects against sustained API failures
- [ ] State transitions work correctly with proper timing
- [ ] Failure rate calculation accurately tracks error rates
- [ ] Recovery mechanism allows gradual service restoration
- [ ] Circuit breaker provides fallback mechanisms for degraded operation
- [ ] State management is thread-safe and atomic
- [ ] All unit tests pass with >95% coverage
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met (<5ms overhead, <1ms state transitions)
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Documentation updated with circuit breaker configuration examples

#### Error Handling
- Circuit breaker gracefully handles null/undefined operations
- Invalid circuit breaker configurations are validated and rejected
- State transition errors are logged with sufficient context
- Fallback mechanisms provide degraded but functional operation

#### Monitoring and Observability
- Circuit breaker state change frequency and timing
- Failure rate tracking and threshold monitoring
- Recovery success rates and timing
- State transition timing metrics
- Fallback mechanism usage tracking

#### Open Questions
- None - all circuit breaker requirements are clear

#### Notes
Focus on creating robust circuit breaker logic that provides effective protection against cascading failures while allowing for graceful recovery. The circuit breaker should be configurable enough to handle different API characteristics while maintaining consistent behavior across all data collection functions. Consider that different APIs may have different failure patterns and recovery characteristics.
