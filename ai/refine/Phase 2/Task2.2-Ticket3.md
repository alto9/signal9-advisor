# Ticket 2.2.3: DynamoDB Integration and Upsert Operations

### Estimate
3 hours

**Status**: Refinement Complete

#### Description
Implement DynamoDB integration and upsert operations for the SyncEarningsCalendar Lambda function. This includes creating efficient batch write operations for earnings calendar data, implementing conflict resolution strategies, tracking synchronization timestamps, and ensuring data consistency in the earningsCalendar table.

#### Technical Details
- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. Create DynamoDB client initialization with proper configuration
  2. Implement batch write operations for efficient earnings data storage (max 25 items per batch)
  3. Create upsert logic with conflict resolution for duplicate earnings using asset_symbol as PK
  4. Implement timestamp tracking for earnings_date (SK) and lastSyncDate fields
  5. Create GSI queries for upcoming-earnings-index for date-based queries
  6. Implement error handling for DynamoDB write failures and retries
  7. Add CloudWatch metrics for DynamoDB operation performance
  8. Create data consistency validation and cleanup procedures
  9. Implement efficient batch processing for large earnings datasets

- **Architecture Considerations**:
  - EarningsCalendar table uses asset_symbol as PK and earnings_date as SK
  - GSI supports upcoming-earnings-index for date-based queries and earnings prioritization
  - Batch operations optimize write performance for large earnings datasets (DynamoDB 25-item limit)
  - Conflict resolution ensures data consistency across sync operations
  - Earnings data mapping: AlphaVantage EARNINGS_CALENDAR CSV â†’ DynamoDB attributes with proper type conversion

- **Security Requirements**:
  - Proper IAM permissions for DynamoDB table access
  - Input validation to prevent DynamoDB injection attacks
  - Secure handling of earnings data without exposing sensitive information

- **Performance Requirements**:
  - Batch write operations should complete within 30 seconds for typical datasets
  - Efficient handling of large earnings datasets (thousands of earnings records)
  - Memory-efficient batch processing without excessive object creation
  - GSI queries should complete within 5 seconds

#### Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**:
  - Task 2.2-Ticket1: SyncEarningsCalendar Lambda Function Core Implementation
  - Task 2.2-Ticket2: Earnings Data Validation and Transformation
  - earningsCalendar DynamoDB table operational with proper schema
  - IAM permissions configured for DynamoDB access
  - CloudWatch metrics namespace configured
- **Dependent Tasks**:
  - Task 2.3: SyncNewsSentiment Lambda Function Implementation
  - Phase 3 earnings-triggered pollination functionality

#### Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**:
  - Test DynamoDB client initialization and configuration
  - Test batch write operations with various earnings datasets (respecting 25-item limit)
  - Test upsert logic with duplicate earnings scenarios using asset_symbol as PK
  - Test conflict resolution strategies for data consistency
  - Test timestamp tracking for earnings_date (SK) and lastSyncDate fields
  - Test GSI operations for upcoming-earnings-index queries
  - Test error handling for DynamoDB failures and retries
  - Test data consistency validation procedures
  - Coverage requirement: >90%

- **Integration Tests**:
  - Test actual DynamoDB table connectivity and operations
  - Test batch write operations with real earnings data
  - Test GSI queries with actual table data
  - Test conflict resolution with concurrent operations

- **Performance Tests**:
  - Test batch write performance with large earnings datasets
  - Verify batch operations complete within 30-second target
  - Test GSI query performance with various date ranges
  - Test memory usage during batch processing

- **Security Tests**:
  - Test IAM permissions for DynamoDB access
  - Verify no sensitive data is exposed in error messages
  - Test input validation for DynamoDB operations

#### Error Handling
- DynamoDB connection failures: Log connection error, emit failure metric, implement retry logic
- Batch write failures: Log batch error details, emit failure metric, retry failed items individually
- Upsert conflicts: Log conflict details, implement conflict resolution strategy, emit conflict metric
- GSI query failures: Log query error, emit failure metric, fall back to base table queries
- Data consistency failures: Log consistency error, emit data quality metric, implement cleanup procedures
- Retry exhaustion: Log retry exhaustion, emit failure metric, return appropriate error response
- Memory pressure: Log memory warning, emit memory metric, implement memory optimization

#### Monitoring and Observability
- **Metrics to track**:
  - DynamoDB write success/failure rates
  - Batch operation performance and timing
  - Upsert conflict rates and resolution success
  - GSI query performance and success rates
  - Data consistency validation results
  - Memory usage during batch processing
  - Retry counts and success rates
- **Logging requirements**:
  - Structured logging for DynamoDB operations
  - Batch operation details and timing
  - Conflict resolution logging
  - GSI query performance logging
  - Error details with retry information
  - Data consistency validation logging
- **Alerting criteria**:
  - DynamoDB write failure rates >5%
  - Batch operation time >45 seconds
  - GSI query failure rates >10%
  - Data consistency failure rates >5%
  - Memory usage >80% of allocation
  - Retry exhaustion events

#### Open Questions
- None - DynamoDB schema and requirements are clear from Phase 1 infrastructure

#### Notes
Focus on creating efficient DynamoDB operations that can handle the large volume of earnings data while maintaining data consistency. The batch processing should be optimized for performance while respecting DynamoDB limits. Pay special attention to conflict resolution strategies and data consistency validation, as earnings data accuracy is critical for downstream processing. The GSI queries should be optimized for efficient date-based filtering of upcoming earnings. Ensure all operations are properly monitored and logged for operational visibility.
