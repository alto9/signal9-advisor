# Ticket 2.1.3: DynamoDB Integration and Upsert Operations

### Estimate
3 hours

**Status**: Refinement Complete

#### Description
Implement DynamoDB integration and upsert operations for the SyncAssets Lambda function. This includes creating efficient batch write operations for asset data, implementing conflict resolution strategies, tracking synchronization timestamps, and ensuring data consistency in the assets table.

#### Technical Details
- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. Create DynamoDB client initialization with proper configuration
  2. Implement batch write operations for efficient asset data storage (max 25 items per batch)
  3. Create upsert logic with conflict resolution for duplicate assets using symbol as PK
  4. Implement timestamp tracking for lastPollenationDate (SK) and lastSyncDate fields
  5. Create GSI queries for status-based asset filtering (active/inactive status)
  6. Implement error handling for DynamoDB write failures and retries
  7. Add CloudWatch metrics for DynamoDB operation performance
  8. Create data consistency validation and cleanup procedures
  9. Map Alpaca Asset fields to DynamoDB schema: symbol (PK), lastPollenationDate (SK), asset data

- **Architecture Considerations**:
  - Assets table uses symbol as PK and lastPollenationDate as SK
  - GSI supports status-based queries (active/inactive) and volume-based prioritization
  - Batch operations optimize write performance for large asset datasets (DynamoDB 25-item limit)
  - Conflict resolution ensures data consistency across sync operations
  - Asset data mapping: Alpaca Asset model â†’ DynamoDB attributes with proper type conversion

- **Security Requirements**:
  - Proper IAM permissions for DynamoDB read/write operations
  - Input validation to prevent DynamoDB injection attacks
  - Secure handling of asset data without exposing sensitive information

- **Performance Requirements**:
  - Batch write operations handle up to 25 items per batch (DynamoDB limit)
  - Efficient processing of thousands of assets within function timeout
  - Optimized GSI queries for status-based filtering
  - Write capacity management to avoid throttling

#### Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**:
  - Task 2.1-Ticket1: SyncAssets Lambda Function Core Implementation
  - Task 2.1-Ticket2: Asset Data Validation and Transformation
  - Phase 1: assets DynamoDB table operational with proper schema
  - IAM permissions configured for DynamoDB access
- **Dependent Tickets**:
  - Task 2.6: Integration Testing and Validation

#### Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**:
  - Test DynamoDB client initialization and configuration
  - Test batch write operations with various asset datasets (respecting 25-item limit)
  - Test upsert logic with duplicate asset scenarios using symbol as PK
  - Test conflict resolution strategies for data consistency
  - Test timestamp tracking for lastPollenationDate (SK) and lastSyncDate fields
  - Test GSI operations for status-based filtering (active/inactive)
  - Test error handling for DynamoDB failures and retries
  - Test data consistency validation procedures
  - Test Alpaca Asset model to DynamoDB schema mapping
  - Coverage requirement: >90%

- **Integration Tests**:
  - Test end-to-end asset data flow from API to DynamoDB storage
  - Test GSI queries for status-based asset filtering
  - Test batch operations with actual DynamoDB table

- **Performance Tests**:
  - Test batch write performance with large asset datasets
  - Verify DynamoDB operation efficiency within function timeout
  - Test GSI query performance for status-based filtering

- **Security Tests**:
  - Test IAM permissions for DynamoDB operations
  - Verify input validation prevents DynamoDB injection
  - Test secure handling of asset data

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] DynamoDB client successfully initializes and connects to assets table
- [ ] Batch write operations efficiently store asset data with proper error handling (max 25 items per batch)
- [ ] Upsert logic correctly handles duplicate assets with conflict resolution using symbol as PK
- [ ] Timestamp tracking accurately updates lastPollenationDate (SK) and lastSyncDate fields
- [ ] GSI queries successfully filter assets by status (active/inactive) and volume
- [ ] Error handling gracefully manages DynamoDB failures and implements retry logic
- [ ] CloudWatch metrics accurately track DynamoDB operation performance
- [ ] Data consistency validation ensures asset data integrity
- [ ] All unit tests pass with >90% coverage
- [ ] Integration tests validate end-to-end data storage workflow
- [ ] Performance tests confirm efficient DynamoDB operations within timeout
- [ ] Security tests validate proper IAM permissions and input validation
- [ ] Code review completed and approved
- [ ] DynamoDB integration documentation updated with examples

#### Error Handling
- DynamoDB connection failures: Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- Batch write failures: Log failed items, implement partial success handling
- Throttling errors: Implement backoff strategy, emit throttling metrics
- Data consistency errors: Log consistency issues, implement cleanup procedures
- GSI query failures: Log query errors, fall back to table scan if necessary

#### Monitoring and Observability
- **Metrics to track**:
  - DynamoDB write success/failure rates
  - Batch operation performance and efficiency
  - Upsert conflict resolution frequency
  - GSI query performance and success rates
  - Data consistency validation results
  - Throttling events and backoff frequency
- **Logging requirements**:
  - Structured logging for DynamoDB operations
  - Batch operation details with success/failure counts
  - Conflict resolution logging for debugging
  - Performance timing for DynamoDB operations
- **Alerting criteria**:
  - DynamoDB write failure rates >5%
  - Batch operation failures >10%
  - GSI query failures >5%
  - Data consistency validation failures

#### Open Questions
- None - DynamoDB schema and requirements are clear from Phase 1

#### Notes
Focus on creating efficient DynamoDB operations that can handle large volumes of asset data while maintaining data consistency. The batch write operations should be optimized for the DynamoDB 25-item limit, and conflict resolution should ensure that asset data remains consistent across multiple sync operations. Pay special attention to GSI performance for status-based queries that will be used by downstream processing.
