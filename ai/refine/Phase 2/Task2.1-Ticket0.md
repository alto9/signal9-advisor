# Ticket 2.1.0: Alpaca SDK Dependency Setup and Configuration

### Estimate
1 hour

**Status**: Refinement Complete

#### Description
Set up the Alpaca TypeScript SDK dependencies and configuration for the SyncAssets Lambda function. This includes installing the required npm packages, configuring TypeScript types, and establishing the development environment for Alpaca API integration.

#### Technical Details
- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. Install `@alpaca/alpaca-trade-api` package in project dependencies
  2. Install `@types/alpaca__alpaca-trade-api` for TypeScript type definitions
  3. Update package.json with Alpaca SDK dependencies
  4. Create TypeScript interfaces for Alpaca Asset model based on `asset.json` schema
  5. Configure TypeScript compilation settings for Alpaca SDK compatibility
  6. Update Lambda function deployment configuration to include new dependencies
  7. Create basic Alpaca API client configuration template

- **Architecture Considerations**:
  - Alpaca SDK integration with existing AWS Lambda TypeScript setup
  - TypeScript type safety for Alpaca Asset model data structures
  - Dependency management for serverless deployment
  - Compatibility with existing AWS SDK dependencies

- **Security Requirements**:
  - Secure dependency installation from npm registry
  - No hardcoded credentials in configuration files
  - Proper version pinning for security and stability

- **Performance Requirements**:
  - Minimal bundle size impact on Lambda function
  - Efficient TypeScript compilation with new dependencies
  - Fast dependency resolution for development and deployment

#### Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**:
  - Phase 1: Infrastructure Foundation completion
  - Existing TypeScript and CDK project setup
  - npm/yarn package management configured
- **Dependent Tickets**:
  - Task 2.1-Ticket1: SyncAssets Lambda Function Core Implementation

#### Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**:
  - Test Alpaca SDK package installation and import
  - Test TypeScript compilation with new dependencies
  - Test TypeScript interfaces for Asset model validation
  - Test basic Alpaca API client initialization
  - Coverage requirement: >80%

- **Integration Tests**:
  - Test Lambda function deployment with new dependencies
  - Test TypeScript compilation in CDK build process

- **Performance Tests**:
  - Test bundle size impact on Lambda function
  - Test compilation time with new dependencies

- **Security Tests**:
  - Verify dependency integrity and security
  - Test for known vulnerabilities in Alpaca SDK

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `@alpaca/alpaca-trade-api` package successfully installed and configured
- [ ] TypeScript interfaces created for Alpaca Asset model based on `asset.json` schema
- [ ] Package.json updated with proper dependency versions
- [ ] TypeScript compilation works without errors
- [ ] Lambda function deployment includes Alpaca SDK dependencies
- [ ] Basic Alpaca API client configuration template created
- [ ] All unit tests pass with >80% coverage
- [ ] Integration tests validate deployment with new dependencies
- [ ] Performance tests confirm minimal bundle size impact
- [ ] Security tests verify dependency integrity
- [ ] Code review completed and approved
- [ ] Dependency documentation updated

#### Error Handling
- Package installation failures: Log installation errors, provide fallback options
- TypeScript compilation errors: Log compilation issues, provide type definition fixes
- Dependency conflicts: Resolve version conflicts, update package.json accordingly
- Deployment failures: Log deployment errors, provide dependency troubleshooting

#### Monitoring and Observability
- **Metrics to track**:
  - Package installation success/failure rates
  - TypeScript compilation time and success rates
  - Lambda bundle size impact
  - Dependency resolution performance
- **Logging requirements**:
  - Structured logging for package installation
  - Compilation error logging with detailed messages
  - Deployment dependency logging
- **Alerting criteria**:
  - Package installation failures
  - TypeScript compilation failures
  - Significant bundle size increases

#### Open Questions
- None - Alpaca SDK requirements are clear from documentation

#### Notes
This ticket should be completed before the main SyncAssets implementation tickets to ensure proper dependency setup. Focus on creating a clean, maintainable dependency configuration that supports the Alpaca API integration requirements. Ensure TypeScript type safety is maintained throughout the integration process.
