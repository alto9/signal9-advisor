# Ticket 2.2.1: SyncEarningsCalendar Lambda Function Core Implementation

### Estimate
6 hours

**Status**: Refinement Complete

#### Description
Implement the core SyncEarningsCalendar Lambda function that performs daily synchronization of earnings calendar data from the AlphaVantage API. This function will query the AlphaVantage EARNINGS_CALENDAR endpoint, process the response data, and prepare it for storage in the earningsCalendar DynamoDB table.

#### Technical Details
- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. Create TypeScript Lambda function structure with proper imports and type definitions
  2. Implement AlphaVantage API client initialization using HTTP requests with credentials from Secrets Manager
  3. Create earnings calendar data fetching logic using EARNINGS_CALENDAR endpoint
  4. Implement TypeScript interfaces for AlphaVantage Earnings Calendar model based on CSV schema
  5. Add structured logging for function entry, API calls, and exit points
  6. Create CloudWatch metrics emission for function execution tracking
  7. Implement timeout handling to ensure function completes within 3-minute limit
  8. Create date parsing and timezone handling for earnings dates

- **Architecture Considerations**:
  - Function integrates with AlphaVantage API using HTTP requests (no official SDK required)
  - Credentials managed through AWS Secrets Manager for security
  - CloudWatch metrics provide operational visibility
  - Function designed for daily execution via EventBridge triggers
  - Earnings data follows AlphaVantage EARNINGS_CALENDAR CSV format: symbol, name, reportDate, fiscalDateEnding, estimate, currency

- **Security Requirements**:
  - API credentials retrieved securely from AWS Secrets Manager
  - No hardcoded credentials in function code
  - Proper IAM permissions for Secrets Manager access
  - Input validation to prevent injection attacks

- **Performance Requirements**:
  - Function must complete within 3-minute timeout
  - Handle large earnings datasets (potentially thousands of earnings records)
  - Efficient memory usage within 256MB allocation
  - API calls should complete within 30 seconds

#### Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**:
  - Phase 1 infrastructure completion (earningsCalendar DynamoDB table, Secrets Manager)
  - AlphaVantage API credentials configured in Secrets Manager
  - CloudWatch log group and metrics namespace configured
- **Dependent Tickets**:
  - Task 2.2-Ticket2: Earnings Data Validation and Transformation
  - Task 2.2-Ticket3: DynamoDB Integration and Upsert Operations

#### Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**:
  - Mock AlphaVantage API responses using actual data structures from `ai/brainstorm/models/alphavantage/EARNINGS_CALENDAR.csv`
  - Test API client initialization with valid/invalid credentials
  - Test earnings calendar data fetching with various response scenarios
  - Test TypeScript interfaces for Earnings Calendar model validation
  - Test date parsing and timezone handling for various date formats
  - Test timeout handling and error scenarios
  - Test CloudWatch metrics emission accuracy
  - Coverage requirement: >90%

- **Integration Tests**:
  - Test Secrets Manager credential retrieval
  - Test actual AlphaVantage API connectivity (with test credentials)

- **Performance Tests**:
  - Test function execution time with large earnings datasets
  - Verify memory usage stays within 256MB limit
  - Test timeout handling under slow API conditions

- **Security Tests**:
  - Verify no credentials are logged or exposed
  - Test input validation and sanitization

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Lambda function successfully initializes AlphaVantage API client with credentials from Secrets Manager
- [ ] Function calls EARNINGS_CALENDAR endpoint and receives valid response
- [ ] Earnings calendar data is properly extracted and structured according to AlphaVantage CSV format
- [ ] Date parsing correctly handles various earnings date formats and timezones
- [ ] CloudWatch metrics accurately track function execution time and success/failure
- [ ] Error handling gracefully manages API failures, timeouts, and authentication issues
- [ ] Function completes execution within 3-minute timeout under normal conditions
- [ ] All unit tests pass with >90% coverage
- [ ] Integration tests validate Secrets Manager and API connectivity
- [ ] Performance tests confirm function meets timeout and memory requirements
- [ ] Security review confirms no credential exposure or injection vulnerabilities
- [ ] Code review completed and approved
- [ ] Function documentation updated with usage examples

#### Error Handling
- API connection failures: Log error details, emit failure metric, return appropriate error response
- Authentication failures: Log security event, emit failure metric, return authentication error
- Timeout scenarios: Implement graceful shutdown, log timeout event, emit timeout metric
- Invalid API responses: Log response validation errors, emit data quality metric
- Secrets Manager failures: Log credential retrieval errors, emit configuration error metric
- Date parsing failures: Log parsing errors, emit data quality metric, continue processing

#### Monitoring and Observability
- **Metrics to track**:
  - Function execution duration
  - API call success/failure rates
  - Earnings record count processed
  - Memory usage
  - Error rates by type
  - Date parsing success/failure rates
- **Logging requirements**:
  - Structured JSON logging for all major events
  - API request/response logging (without sensitive data)
  - Error details with stack traces
  - Performance timing information
  - Date parsing and timezone conversion logging
- **Alerting criteria**:
  - Function execution failures
  - API call failure rates >5%
  - Execution time approaching timeout (>2.5 minutes)
  - Date parsing failure rates >10%

#### Open Questions
- None - all requirements are clear from Phase 2 plan and AlphaVantage API documentation

#### Notes
Focus on creating a robust, maintainable function that provides excellent operational visibility. The function should be designed to handle the large volume of earnings data efficiently while providing clear error messages for troubleshooting. Pay special attention to date parsing and timezone handling as earnings dates are critical for downstream processing. Ensure all logging follows structured JSON format for easy parsing and analysis.
