# Ticket 2.6.1: End-to-End Workflow Testing and Data Flow Validation

### Estimate
1.5 hours

**Status**: Refinement Complete

#### Description
Perform comprehensive end-to-end testing of all three data collection workflows (SyncAssets, SyncEarningsCalendar, SyncNewsSentiment) to ensure they work together seamlessly. This includes validating data flow integrity from APIs through validation to DynamoDB storage, and verifying that all components integrate correctly.

#### Technical Details
- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. Create `tests/integration/workflows/` directory structure
  2. Implement `WorkflowTestSuite` class for end-to-end testing framework
  3. Create `testSyncAssetsWorkflow()` method with mocked Alpaca API responses
  4. Implement `testSyncEarningsCalendarWorkflow()` method with mocked AlphaVantage API responses
  5. Create `testSyncNewsSentimentWorkflow()` method with mocked AlphaVantage API responses
  6. Implement `DataFlowValidator` class for data flow integrity validation
  7. Create `validateDataFlow<T>(sourceData: T[], processedData: T[], storedData: T[]): DataFlowResult` method
  8. Implement `MockAPIServer` class for consistent API response mocking
  9. Create `setupMockAlpacaAPI()` method with realistic asset data responses
  10. Implement `setupMockAlphaVantageAPI()` method with earnings and news data responses
  11. Create `DynamoDBValidator` class for storage validation
  12. Implement `validateDynamoDBData(tableName: string, expectedData: any[]): ValidationResult` method
  13. Add comprehensive integration tests for all workflow scenarios
  14. Create test documentation and procedures

- **Architecture Considerations**:
  - Mock API responses use actual data structures from models folders
  - Data flow validation ensures no data loss or corruption
  - DynamoDB validation verifies correct table structure and data integrity
  - Workflow testing covers both success and failure scenarios
  - Integration tests run in isolated test environment

- **Security Requirements**:
  - Mock API responses don't contain sensitive data
  - Test data is isolated from production data
  - Test credentials are not used in integration tests

- **Performance Requirements**:
  - End-to-end workflow tests complete within 5 minutes
  - Data flow validation completes within 30 seconds per workflow
  - Mock API responses are served within 100ms

#### Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**:
  - All previous Phase 2 tasks (2.1-2.5) completed
  - Phase 1 infrastructure operational
  - Test environment configured
- **Dependent Tickets**:
  - Task2.6-Ticket2: Scheduled Trigger and EventBridge Testing
  - Task2.6-Ticket3: Monitoring and Error Handling Integration Testing

#### Testing Requirements
- **Integration Tests**:
  - Test SyncAssets workflow with mocked Alpaca API responses
  - Test SyncEarningsCalendar workflow with mocked AlphaVantage API responses
  - Test SyncNewsSentiment workflow with mocked AlphaVantage API responses
  - Validate data flow from API responses to DynamoDB storage
  - Test workflow integration with validation framework
  - Test workflow integration with error handling framework
  - Test edge cases: empty API responses, partial failures, timeout scenarios
  - Test coverage target: >90%

- **Performance Tests**:
  - Measure end-to-end workflow execution time (<5 minutes per workflow)
  - Test data flow validation performance (<30 seconds per workflow)
  - Verify mock API response performance (<100ms per response)

- **Data Integrity Tests**:
  - Verify no data loss during API to DynamoDB flow
  - Validate data transformation and validation accuracy
  - Test data consistency across all workflow components

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All three data collection workflows complete successfully in integrated environment
- [ ] Data flows correctly from API sources through validation to DynamoDB storage
- [ ] Mock API responses accurately simulate real API behavior
- [ ] Data flow validation ensures no data loss or corruption
- [ ] DynamoDB validation confirms correct data storage
- [ ] Workflow integration with validation framework works correctly
- [ ] Workflow integration with error handling framework works correctly
- [ ] All integration tests pass with >90% coverage
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met (workflow <5min, validation <30s, API <100ms)
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Test documentation provides clear procedures for ongoing validation

#### Error Handling
- Integration tests gracefully handle test environment failures
- Mock API failures are properly simulated and handled
- Data flow validation provides detailed error reporting
- Test cleanup ensures no residual test data

#### Monitoring and Observability
- Workflow execution timing metrics
- Data flow validation success rates
- Mock API response timing and accuracy
- DynamoDB validation performance metrics
- Integration test execution statistics

#### Open Questions
- None - all workflow testing requirements are clear

#### Notes
Focus on creating comprehensive end-to-end tests that validate the complete data collection workflows. The tests should use realistic mock data that accurately simulates the behavior of real APIs while ensuring data integrity throughout the entire flow. Consider that integration tests may reveal issues that weren't apparent during unit testing.
