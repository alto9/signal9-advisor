# Ticket 2.5.1: Exponential Backoff Retry Logic Implementation

### Estimate
2 hours

**Status**: Refinement Complete

#### Description
Implement exponential backoff retry logic with configurable parameters that can be utilized across all data collection Lambda functions. This includes retry strategies for API calls, timeout handling, and configurable retry limits to ensure resilient data collection operations.

#### Technical Details
- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. Create `src/error-handling/retry/` directory structure
  2. Implement `RetryConfig` interface with configurable parameters:
     - baseDelay: number (1-2 seconds)
     - maxDelay: number (30 seconds)
     - maxRetries: number (3 retries)
     - backoffMultiplier: number (2x exponential)
  3. Create `ExponentialBackoffRetry` class extending BaseRetryStrategy
  4. Implement `executeWithRetry<T>(operation: () => Promise<T>, config?: RetryConfig): Promise<T>` method
  5. Create `RetryContext` interface for tracking retry state and metadata
  6. Implement `shouldRetry(error: Error, attempt: number, config: RetryConfig): boolean` method
  7. Create `calculateDelay(attempt: number, config: RetryConfig): number` method
  8. Implement `RetryLogger` class for structured retry logging
  9. Create `logRetryAttempt(context: RetryContext, error: Error): void` method
  10. Add comprehensive unit tests for all retry scenarios
  11. Create retry utilities for Lambda function integration

- **Architecture Considerations**:
  - Retry logic is configurable per operation type
  - Exponential backoff prevents overwhelming external APIs
  - Retry context provides detailed logging for operational visibility
  - Timeout handling prevents indefinite retry loops
  - Retry strategies are extensible for different failure patterns

- **Security Requirements**:
  - Retry logic doesn't expose sensitive data in error logs
  - Configurable retry limits prevent resource exhaustion attacks
  - Timeout handling prevents denial of service scenarios

- **Performance Requirements**:
  - Retry logic adds <10ms overhead to successful operations
  - Retry delays are calculated efficiently (<1ms per calculation)
  - Memory usage remains constant during retry operations

#### Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**:
  - Phase 1: Infrastructure Foundation completion
  - TypeScript project structure established
- **Dependent Tickets**:
  - Task2.5-Ticket2: Circuit Breaker Pattern Implementation
  - Task2.5-Ticket4: Lambda Integration Utilities

#### Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**:
  - Test exponential backoff delay calculations with various configurations
  - Test retry logic with different error types (network, timeout, rate limit)
  - Test retry limit enforcement (max 3 retries)
  - Test delay range validation (1-2s base, max 30s)
  - Test shouldRetry logic with different error scenarios
  - Test retry context tracking and metadata
  - Test retry logging with structured data
  - Test edge cases: null operations, invalid configs, infinite loops
  - Test coverage target: >95%

- **Integration Tests**:
  - Test retry logic with mocked API operations
  - Verify retry behavior with actual error conditions
  - Test Lambda function integration patterns

- **Performance Tests**:
  - Measure retry logic overhead (<10ms for successful operations)
  - Test delay calculation performance (<1ms per calculation)
  - Verify memory usage remains constant during retries

- **Security Tests**:
  - Test retry limits prevent resource exhaustion
  - Verify error logging doesn't expose sensitive data
  - Test timeout handling prevents infinite loops

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Exponential backoff correctly implements specified timing and retry limits
- [ ] Retry logic handles different error types appropriately
- [ ] Configurable retry parameters work correctly
- [ ] Retry context provides detailed operational visibility
- [ ] Retry logging includes structured data for monitoring
- [ ] Timeout handling prevents resource leaks
- [ ] All unit tests pass with >95% coverage
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met (<10ms overhead, <1ms delay calculation)
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Documentation updated with retry configuration examples

#### Error Handling
- Retry logic gracefully handles null/undefined operations
- Invalid retry configurations are validated and rejected
- Timeout errors are handled with appropriate cleanup
- Retry failures are logged with sufficient context for debugging

#### Monitoring and Observability
- Retry attempt frequency and success rates
- Retry delay timing metrics
- Error type distribution for retry operations
- Retry context metadata for operational analysis
- Performance overhead tracking for retry operations

#### Open Questions
- None - all retry logic requirements are clear

#### Notes
Focus on creating robust, predictable retry logic that provides clear operational visibility. The retry mechanism should be configurable enough to handle different API characteristics while maintaining consistent behavior across all data collection functions. Consider that different APIs may have different rate limits and failure patterns.
