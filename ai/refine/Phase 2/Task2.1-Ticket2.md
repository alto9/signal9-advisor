# Ticket 2.1.2: Asset Data Validation and Transformation

### Estimate
3 hours

**Status**: Refinement Complete

#### Description
Implement comprehensive asset data validation and transformation logic for the SyncAssets Lambda function. This includes validating asset data against the Alpaca Assets Model schema, transforming data into the required format for DynamoDB storage, and implementing soft failure handling for data quality issues.

#### Technical Details
- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. Create asset data validation functions based on Alpaca Asset model schema from `asset.json`
  2. Implement required field validation for: id, symbol, name, status, tradable, exchange, class
  3. Create symbol format validation (exchange standards, ticker patterns)
  4. Implement data type validation for: margin_requirement_long, margin_requirement_short, maintenance_margin_requirement
  5. Create boolean field validation for: tradable, marginable, shortable, easy_to_borrow, fractionable
  6. Create data transformation logic to convert Alpaca Asset model to DynamoDB format
  7. Implement soft failure handling for individual asset validation failures
  8. Add validation metrics tracking for data quality monitoring
  9. Create comprehensive logging for validation failures and transformations

- **Architecture Considerations**:
  - Validation logic integrates with data validation framework from Task 2.4
  - Soft failure handling allows processing to continue with invalid records logged
  - Transformation logic prepares data for DynamoDB upsert operations
  - Validation metrics feed into CloudWatch for data quality monitoring
  - Asset model validation based on Alpaca Asset schema: id (UUID), symbol (string), status (active/inactive), etc.

- **Security Requirements**:
  - Input sanitization to prevent injection attacks
  - Validation of symbol formats to prevent malicious data
  - Proper error handling without exposing sensitive information

- **Performance Requirements**:
  - Validation overhead should add <100ms to typical processing
  - Efficient handling of large asset datasets (thousands of assets)
  - Memory-efficient validation without excessive object creation

#### Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**:
  - Task 2.1-Ticket1: SyncAssets Lambda Function Core Implementation
  - Task 2.4: Data Validation Framework Implementation (for reusable validation functions)
  - Alpaca Assets Model schema documentation
- **Dependent Tickets**:
  - Task 2.1-Ticket3: DynamoDB Integration and Upsert Operations

#### Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**:
  - Test validation functions with valid asset data from `ai/brainstorm/models/alpaca/asset.json`
  - Test validation with invalid/malformed asset data
  - Test required field validation for: id, symbol, name, status, tradable, exchange, class
  - Test symbol format validation with various exchange formats (NYSE, NASDAQ, OTC, etc.)
  - Test data type validation for margin requirement fields (string/number)
  - Test boolean field validation for: tradable, marginable, shortable, easy_to_borrow, fractionable
  - Test transformation logic with various asset types (us_equity, crypto, etc.)
  - Test soft failure handling with mixed valid/invalid data
  - Coverage requirement: >95%

- **Integration Tests**:
  - Test validation with actual Alpaca API response data
  - Test transformation output format for DynamoDB compatibility

- **Performance Tests**:
  - Test validation performance with large asset datasets
  - Verify validation overhead stays within 100ms target

- **Security Tests**:
  - Test input sanitization with potentially malicious data
  - Verify no sensitive information is exposed in validation errors

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Asset data validation correctly identifies valid and invalid records according to Alpaca Asset model schema
- [ ] Required field validation ensures all essential fields are present: id, symbol, name, status, tradable, exchange, class
- [ ] Symbol format validation handles various exchange standards (NYSE, NASDAQ, OTC, etc.) and ticker patterns
- [ ] Data type validation correctly validates margin requirement fields (string/number) and boolean fields
- [ ] Data transformation logic converts API response to proper DynamoDB format
- [ ] Soft failure handling allows processing to continue while logging validation failures
- [ ] Validation metrics accurately track data quality and validation success rates
- [ ] Validation overhead adds <100ms to typical asset processing operations
- [ ] All unit tests pass with >95% coverage
- [ ] Integration tests validate end-to-end data flow from API to transformation
- [ ] Performance tests confirm validation meets timing requirements
- [ ] Security tests confirm proper input sanitization and error handling
- [ ] Code review completed and approved
- [ ] Validation logic documentation updated with examples

#### Error Handling
- Invalid symbol formats: Log validation error, mark asset as invalid, continue processing
- Missing required fields: Log field validation error, mark asset as invalid, continue processing
- Invalid data types: Log type validation error, mark asset as invalid, continue processing
- Transformation failures: Log transformation error, mark asset as invalid, continue processing
- Validation framework errors: Log framework error, emit validation framework failure metric

#### Monitoring and Observability
- **Metrics to track**:
  - Asset validation success/failure rates
  - Validation error types and frequencies
  - Data transformation success rates
  - Validation processing time
  - Invalid asset count and reasons
- **Logging requirements**:
  - Structured logging for validation failures with asset details
  - Transformation logging for debugging data format issues
  - Validation metrics logging for operational monitoring
- **Alerting criteria**:
  - Validation failure rates >10%
  - Transformation failure rates >5%
  - Validation processing time >200ms

#### Open Questions
- None - validation requirements are clear from Alpaca Assets Model schema

#### Notes
Focus on creating robust validation logic that can handle edge cases in asset data while maintaining performance. The validation should be comprehensive enough to catch data quality issues but efficient enough to not impact overall function performance. Soft failure handling is critical to ensure that a few bad records don't prevent the entire sync from completing successfully.
