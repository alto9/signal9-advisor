# Ticket 2.2.2: Earnings Data Validation and Transformation

### Estimate
3 hours

**Status**: Refinement Complete

#### Description
Implement comprehensive earnings data validation and transformation logic for the SyncEarningsCalendar Lambda function. This includes validating earnings data against the AlphaVantage EARNINGS_CALENDAR CSV schema, transforming data into the required format for DynamoDB storage, and implementing soft failure handling for data quality issues.

#### Technical Details
- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. Create earnings data validation functions based on AlphaVantage EARNINGS_CALENDAR CSV schema
  2. Implement required field validation for: symbol, name, reportDate, fiscalDateEnding, estimate, currency
  3. Create symbol format validation and cross-reference validation with assets table
  4. Implement date validation for reportDate and fiscalDateEnding fields
  5. Create estimate validation for numeric format and currency validation
  6. Create data transformation logic to convert CSV response to DynamoDB format
  7. Implement soft failure handling for individual earnings validation failures
  8. Add validation metrics tracking for data quality monitoring
  9. Create comprehensive logging for validation failures and transformations

- **Architecture Considerations**:
  - Validation logic integrates with data validation framework from Task 2.4
  - Soft failure handling allows processing to continue with invalid records logged
  - Transformation logic prepares data for DynamoDB upsert operations
  - Validation metrics feed into CloudWatch for data quality monitoring
  - Cross-reference validation ensures earnings data corresponds to tracked assets

- **Security Requirements**:
  - Input sanitization to prevent injection attacks
  - Validation of symbol formats to prevent malicious data
  - Proper error handling without exposing sensitive information

- **Performance Requirements**:
  - Validation overhead should add <100ms to typical processing
  - Efficient handling of large earnings datasets (thousands of earnings records)
  - Memory-efficient validation without excessive object creation

#### Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**:
  - Task 2.2-Ticket1: SyncEarningsCalendar Lambda Function Core Implementation
  - Task 2.4: Data Validation Framework Implementation (for reusable validation functions)
  - Task 2.1: SyncAssets Lambda Function Implementation (for asset cross-reference validation)
  - AlphaVantage EARNINGS_CALENDAR CSV schema documentation
- **Dependent Tickets**:
  - Task 2.2-Ticket3: DynamoDB Integration and Upsert Operations

#### Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**:
  - Test validation functions with valid earnings data from `ai/brainstorm/models/alphavantage/EARNINGS_CALENDAR.csv`
  - Test validation with invalid/malformed earnings data
  - Test required field validation for: symbol, name, reportDate, fiscalDateEnding, estimate, currency
  - Test symbol format validation and cross-reference with assets table
  - Test date validation for various date formats and timezones
  - Test estimate validation for numeric formats and currency validation
  - Test transformation logic with various earnings types
  - Test soft failure handling with mixed valid/invalid data
  - Coverage requirement: >95%

- **Integration Tests**:
  - Test validation with actual AlphaVantage API response data
  - Test transformation output format for DynamoDB compatibility
  - Test cross-reference validation with assets table

- **Performance Tests**:
  - Test validation performance with large earnings datasets
  - Verify validation overhead stays within 100ms target

- **Security Tests**:
  - Test input sanitization with potentially malicious data
  - Verify no sensitive information is exposed in validation errors

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Earnings data validation correctly identifies valid and invalid records according to AlphaVantage EARNINGS_CALENDAR CSV schema
- [ ] Required field validation ensures all essential fields are present: symbol, name, reportDate, fiscalDateEnding, estimate, currency
- [ ] Symbol validation correctly handles various formats and cross-references with assets table
- [ ] Date validation properly handles various date formats and timezone considerations
- [ ] Estimate validation correctly validates numeric formats and currency codes
- [ ] Data transformation logic converts CSV response to proper DynamoDB format
- [ ] Soft failure handling allows processing to continue while logging validation failures
- [ ] Cross-reference validation ensures earnings data corresponds to tracked assets
- [ ] Validation metrics accurately track data quality and validation success rates
- [ ] Validation overhead adds <100ms to typical earnings processing operations
- [ ] All unit tests pass with >95% coverage
- [ ] Integration tests validate end-to-end data flow from API to transformation
- [ ] Performance tests confirm validation meets timing requirements
- [ ] Security tests confirm proper input sanitization and error handling
- [ ] Code review completed and approved
- [ ] Validation logic documentation updated with examples

#### Error Handling
- Invalid symbol formats: Log validation error, mark earnings as invalid, continue processing
- Missing required fields: Log field validation error, mark earnings as invalid, continue processing
- Invalid date formats: Log date validation error, mark earnings as invalid, continue processing
- Invalid estimate formats: Log estimate validation error, mark earnings as invalid, continue processing
- Cross-reference failures: Log cross-reference error, mark earnings as invalid, continue processing
- Transformation failures: Log transformation error, mark earnings as invalid, continue processing
- Validation framework errors: Log framework error, emit validation framework failure metric

#### Monitoring and Observability
- **Metrics to track**:
  - Earnings validation success/failure rates
  - Validation error types and frequencies
  - Data transformation success rates
  - Validation processing time
  - Invalid earnings count and reasons
  - Cross-reference validation success rates
- **Logging requirements**:
  - Structured logging for validation failures with earnings details
  - Transformation logging for debugging data format issues
  - Validation metrics logging for operational monitoring
  - Cross-reference validation logging
- **Alerting criteria**:
  - Validation failure rates >10%
  - Transformation failure rates >5%
  - Validation processing time >200ms
  - Cross-reference failure rates >15%

#### Open Questions
- None - validation requirements are clear from AlphaVantage EARNINGS_CALENDAR CSV schema

#### Notes
Focus on creating robust validation logic that can handle edge cases in earnings data while maintaining performance. The validation should be comprehensive enough to catch data quality issues but efficient enough to not impact overall function performance. Pay special attention to date validation and cross-reference validation with the assets table, as these are critical for data integrity. Soft failure handling is essential to ensure that a few bad records don't prevent the entire sync from completing successfully.
