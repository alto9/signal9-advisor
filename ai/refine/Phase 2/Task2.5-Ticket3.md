# Ticket 2.5.3: Dead Letter Queue Integration and Graceful Degradation

### Estimate
2 hours

**Status**: Refinement Complete

#### Description
Implement dead letter queue integration for failed Lambda executions and graceful degradation mechanisms that allow partial processing success. This includes DLQ message handling, partial success tracking, and cleanup procedures for failed operations.

#### Technical Details
- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. Create `src/error-handling/dlq/` directory structure
  2. Implement `DeadLetterQueueHandler` class for DLQ integration
  3. Create `sendToDLQ(message: any, error: Error, context: any): Promise<void>` method
  4. Implement `DLQMessage` interface with structured message format:
     - originalMessage: any
     - error: Error
     - context: any
     - timestamp: number
     - retryCount: number
  5. Create `GracefulDegradationHandler` class for partial success tracking
  6. Implement `trackPartialSuccess<T>(data: T[], processed: T[], failed: T[]): PartialSuccessResult` method
  7. Create `PartialSuccessResult` interface with success/failure metrics
  8. Implement `CleanupHandler` class for resource cleanup procedures
  9. Create `performCleanup(resources: any[]): Promise<void>` method
  10. Implement `TimeoutHandler` class for timeout management
  11. Create `handleTimeout(operation: () => Promise<any>, timeoutMs: number): Promise<any>` method
  12. Add comprehensive unit tests for all DLQ and degradation scenarios
  13. Create DLQ and degradation utilities for Lambda function integration

- **Architecture Considerations**:
  - DLQ messages include sufficient context for debugging and reprocessing
  - Partial success tracking provides detailed metrics for operational visibility
  - Cleanup procedures prevent resource leaks during failures
  - Timeout handling ensures operations don't hang indefinitely
  - Graceful degradation allows processing to continue with available data

- **Security Requirements**:
  - DLQ messages don't expose sensitive data
  - Cleanup procedures handle sensitive resources securely
  - Error context is sanitized before logging

- **Performance Requirements**:
  - DLQ operations complete in <100ms
  - Partial success tracking adds <5ms overhead per record
  - Cleanup procedures complete within timeout limits
  - Memory usage remains constant during degradation scenarios

#### Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**:
  - Phase 1: Infrastructure Foundation completion (DLQ setup)
  - Task2.5-Ticket1: Exponential Backoff Retry Logic Implementation
- **Dependent Tickets**:
  - Task2.5-Ticket4: Lambda Integration Utilities

#### Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**:
  - Test DLQ message creation and formatting
  - Test DLQ message sending with various error types
  - Test partial success tracking with different data scenarios
  - Test cleanup procedures with various resource types
  - Test timeout handling with different timeout values
  - Test graceful degradation with mixed success/failure scenarios
  - Test error context sanitization and security
  - Test edge cases: empty data, null errors, invalid resources
  - Test coverage target: >95%

- **Integration Tests**:
  - Test DLQ integration with actual SQS dead letter queues
  - Verify partial success tracking with real data processing
  - Test cleanup procedures with actual AWS resources

- **Performance Tests**:
  - Measure DLQ operation performance (<100ms per message)
  - Test partial success tracking overhead (<5ms per record)
  - Test cleanup procedure performance within timeout limits
  - Verify memory usage remains constant

- **Security Tests**:
  - Test DLQ message security (no sensitive data exposure)
  - Verify cleanup procedure security
  - Test error context sanitization

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Dead letter queue integration captures failed executions for analysis
- [ ] DLQ messages include sufficient context for debugging and reprocessing
- [ ] Graceful degradation allows partial processing success
- [ ] Partial success tracking provides detailed metrics
- [ ] Cleanup procedures prevent resource leaks
- [ ] Timeout handling prevents indefinite hangs
- [ ] Error context is properly sanitized and secured
- [ ] All unit tests pass with >95% coverage
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met (DLQ <100ms, tracking <5ms per record)
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Documentation updated with DLQ and degradation examples

#### Error Handling
- DLQ operations gracefully handle queue unavailability
- Partial success tracking handles null/undefined data
- Cleanup procedures handle resource cleanup failures
- Timeout handling provides clear error messages for debugging

#### Monitoring and Observability
- DLQ message volume and error type distribution
- Partial success rates and failure patterns
- Cleanup procedure success rates and timing
- Timeout frequency and duration tracking
- Resource leak detection and monitoring

#### Open Questions
- None - all DLQ and degradation requirements are clear

#### Notes
Focus on creating robust DLQ and degradation mechanisms that provide clear operational visibility while ensuring data integrity. The DLQ should capture sufficient context for debugging and reprocessing, while graceful degradation should allow the system to continue operating with partial data when possible. Consider that different types of failures may require different handling strategies.
