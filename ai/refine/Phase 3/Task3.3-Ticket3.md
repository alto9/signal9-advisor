  5. Implement data normalization for consistent storage format
  6. Create validation rules for financial ratios and data consistency
  7. Implement data deduplication logic for historical records
  8. Create processing status tracking for large datasets
  9. Implement memory-efficient streaming for large dataset processing
  10. Create validation reporting for data quality metrics

  - Bulk processing success/failure rates
  - Data transformation performance and error rates
  - Validation failure rates by rule type
  - Data quality metrics (completeness, consistency, accuracy)
  - Processing time for different dataset sizes
  - Memory usage during bulk processing
- **Logging requirements**:
  - Bulk processing progress and status updates
  - Data transformation results and error details
  - Validation rule violations and data quality issues
  - Processing performance metrics and timing
  - Memory usage patterns during large dataset processing
- **Alerting criteria**:
  - Bulk processing failure rate >10%
  - Data transformation error rate >15%
  - Validation failure rate >20%
