### Estimate
2 hours

**Status**: Refinement Complete

#### Description
Implement DynamoDB bulk upsert operations for all foundational data tables and complete the final integration of the PollenateAsset Lambda function. This ticket focuses on efficient bulk data storage using DynamoDB batch writes, updating asset status tracking, and ensuring complete end-to-end functionality of the comprehensive financial data collection system.

#### Technical Details
- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. Implement DynamoDB batch write operations for companyOverview table
  2. Implement DynamoDB batch write operations for earnings table
  3. Implement DynamoDB batch write operations for cashFlow table
  4. Implement DynamoDB batch write operations for balanceSheet table
  5. Implement DynamoDB batch write operations for incomeStatement table
  6. Create efficient batch write strategy for large datasets (20-50 records per type)
  7. Implement asset status update (lastPollenationDate) in assets table
  8. Create error handling for DynamoDB batch write failures
  9. Implement retry logic for failed batch operations
  10. Create final integration testing and validation

- **Architecture Considerations**:
  - Efficient batch write operations using DynamoDB batch write API
  - Transactional updates for asset status tracking
  - Error isolation prevents single table failure from stopping entire process
  - Batch size optimization for DynamoDB write capacity and performance
  - Final integration ensures complete end-to-end functionality

- **Security Requirements**:
  - Secure handling of financial data during DynamoDB operations
  - Input validation for all data before storage operations
  - Proper error handling to prevent data exposure in logs

- **Performance Requirements**:
  - Bulk upsert operations complete within 1 minute for typical datasets
  - Efficient use of DynamoDB write capacity units
  - Batch size optimization for maximum throughput
  - CloudWatch metrics for storage performance and success rates

#### Dependencies

  - Task 3.5: Event Orchestration and Integration Testing

#### Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**:
  - DynamoDB batch write operation testing for each table
  - Batch size optimization testing with various dataset sizes
  - Error handling testing for DynamoDB write failures
  - Retry logic testing for failed batch operations
  - Asset status update testing in assets table
  - Transactional update testing for status tracking
  - Performance testing for bulk upsert operations

- **Integration Tests**:
  - End-to-end bulk upsert testing with real DynamoDB tables
  - Performance testing with maximum dataset sizes
  - Error handling integration testing with actual DynamoDB failures

- **Performance Tests**:
  - Bulk upsert timing validation within 1-minute constraint
  - DynamoDB write capacity utilization testing
  - Batch size performance optimization testing

- **Security Tests**:
  - Data validation before storage operations
  - Secure error handling without data exposure

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] DynamoDB batch write operations successfully store data in all 5 foundational tables
- [ ] companyOverview table receives basic company information and financial ratios
- [ ] earnings table receives complete historical earnings data (annual + quarterly)
- [ ] cashFlow table receives complete cash flow history (annual + quarterly statements)
- [ ] balanceSheet table receives complete balance sheet history (annual + quarterly statements)
- [ ] incomeStatement table receives complete income statement history (annual + quarterly statements)
- [ ] Asset status update (lastPollenationDate) correctly updated in assets table
- [ ] Batch write operations handle large datasets efficiently (20-50 records per type)
- [ ] Error handling manages DynamoDB write failures gracefully
- [ ] Retry logic successfully processes failed batch operations
- [ ] Bulk upsert operations complete within 1 minute for typical asset datasets
- [ ] CloudWatch metrics track storage performance and success rates
- [ ] All unit tests pass with >90% coverage
- [ ] Integration tests validate end-to-end bulk storage operations
- [ ] Performance tests confirm timing and DynamoDB capacity requirements
- [ ] Complete PollenateAsset function operational and ready for production

#### Error Handling
- DynamoDB write capacity exceeded: Implement exponential backoff retry with 1-5 second delays
- Individual table write failures: Continue processing other tables, track partial success
- Batch write failures: Retry failed batches with exponential backoff up to 3 attempts
- Transactional update failures: Log error, emit failure metrics, continue processing
- Network timeouts: Retry with exponential backoff up to 3 attempts per operation
- Memory pressure: Implement data streaming for large datasets, optimize memory usage

#### Monitoring and Observability
- **Metrics to track**:
  - DynamoDB batch write success/failure rates by table
  - Bulk upsert completion time and performance
  - Write capacity utilization and throttling events
  - Asset status update success/failure rates
  - Retry frequency and success rates for failed operations
- **Logging requirements**:
  - DynamoDB batch write operation details (table, batch size, success/failure)
  - Write capacity utilization and throttling events
  - Asset status update results and timing
  - Retry attempts and backoff delays for failed operations
  - Performance metrics for bulk storage operations
- **Alerting criteria**:
  - DynamoDB batch write failure rate >15%
  - Bulk upsert timeout (>1 minute)
  - Write capacity throttling frequency >20%
  - Asset status update failure rate >10%

#### Open Questions
- None - all requirements clarified

#### Notes
This ticket completes the PollenateAsset Lambda function implementation. Focus on creating efficient bulk storage operations that can handle large historical datasets within the time constraints. Ensure the asset status tracking provides clear visibility into pollination completion for operational monitoring. The final integration testing is critical to validate the complete end-to-end functionality.
