# Ticket 3.3.2: Sequential AlphaVantage API Call Implementation

### Estimate
8 hours

**Status**: Refinement Complete

#### Description
Implement sequential API call logic for all 5 AlphaVantage fundamental data endpoints within the PollenateAsset function. This ticket focuses on creating robust, sequential data collection from COMPANY_OVERVIEW, EARNINGS, CASH_FLOW, BALANCE_SHEET, and INCOME_STATEMENT endpoints with proper error handling, rate limiting, and data validation.

#### Technical Details
- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. Implement COMPANY_OVERVIEW API call with response validation
  2. Implement EARNINGS API call for complete historical data (annual + quarterly)
  3. Implement CASH_FLOW API call for complete cash flow history
  4. Implement BALANCE_SHEET API call for complete balance sheet history
  5. Implement INCOME_STATEMENT API call for complete income statement history
  6. Create sequential execution logic with proper error handling
  7. Implement rate limiting to respect AlphaVantage API limits
  8. Add response validation for each endpoint with specific data quality checks
  9. Create retry logic with exponential backoff for failed API calls
  10. Implement partial success tracking for multi-endpoint processing

- **Architecture Considerations**:
  - Sequential processing ensures data consistency across endpoints
  - Rate limiting prevents API quota exhaustion
  - Modular API call functions for maintainability and testing
  - Response caching strategy to minimize redundant API calls
  - Error isolation prevents single endpoint failure from stopping entire process

- **Security Requirements**:
  - API response validation to prevent malicious data injection
  - Secure handling of financial data in memory during processing
  - Rate limiting to prevent API abuse and quota exhaustion

- **Performance Requirements**:
  - Sequential API calls complete within 8 minutes (leaving 2 minutes for data processing)
  - Rate limiting: Maximum 5 API calls per minute to respect AlphaVantage limits
  - Memory efficient processing of large historical datasets
  - CloudWatch metrics for individual endpoint performance

#### Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**:
  - Task 3.3-Ticket1: PollenateAsset Lambda Function Core Structure and AlphaVantage Integration Setup
  - AlphaVantage API credentials and endpoint access confirmed
- **Dependent Tickets**:
  - Task 3.3-Ticket3: Bulk Data Processing and Validation
  - Task 3.3-Ticket4: DynamoDB Bulk Upsert Operations

#### Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**:
  - Individual API call function testing with mocked responses
  - Sequential execution logic testing with various success/failure scenarios
  - Rate limiting logic testing and validation
  - Response validation testing for each endpoint with valid/invalid data
  - Retry logic testing with exponential backoff validation
  - Partial success tracking testing for multi-endpoint scenarios

- **Integration Tests**:
  - End-to-end sequential API call testing with real AlphaVantage responses
  - Rate limiting integration testing under load
  - Error handling integration testing with actual API failures

- **Performance Tests**:
  - Sequential API call timing validation within 8-minute constraint
  - Memory usage testing with large historical datasets
  - Rate limiting performance impact assessment

- **Security Tests**:
  - API response validation with malicious data injection attempts
  - Rate limiting security testing to prevent API abuse

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All 5 AlphaVantage endpoints called sequentially with proper error handling
- [ ] COMPANY_OVERVIEW API returns basic company information and financial ratios
- [ ] EARNINGS API returns complete historical earnings (annual + quarterly, 10+ years)
- [ ] CASH_FLOW API returns complete cash flow history (annual + quarterly statements)
- [ ] BALANCE_SHEET API returns complete balance sheet history (annual + quarterly statements)
- [ ] INCOME_STATEMENT API returns complete income statement history (annual + quarterly statements)
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents API quota exhaustion (max 5 calls/minute)
- [ ] Sequential execution completes within 8 minutes for typical asset processing
- [ ] Retry logic handles temporary API failures with exponential backoff
- [ ] Partial success tracking maintains processing state across endpoint failures
- [ ] Response validation catches data quality issues for each endpoint
- [ ] CloudWatch metrics track individual endpoint performance and success rates
- [ ] All unit tests pass with >90% coverage
- [ ] Integration tests validate end-to-end sequential processing
- [ ] Performance tests confirm timing and memory usage requirements

#### Error Handling
- API rate limit exceeded: Implement exponential backoff retry with 1-5 minute delays
- Individual endpoint failures: Continue processing other endpoints, track partial success
- Invalid API responses: Log validation errors, skip problematic data, continue processing
- Network timeouts: Retry with exponential backoff up to 3 attempts per endpoint
- API authentication failures: Stop processing, log error, emit failure metrics
- Memory pressure: Implement data streaming for large responses, optimize memory usage

#### Monitoring and Observability
- **Metrics to track**:
  - Individual endpoint success/failure rates
  - Sequential processing completion time
  - Rate limiting trigger frequency
  - Partial success rates for multi-endpoint processing
  - API response validation failure rates
- **Logging requirements**:
  - Individual API call details (endpoint, timing, success/failure)
  - Rate limiting events and delays
  - Response validation results and data quality issues
  - Partial success tracking for failed endpoints
  - Retry attempts and backoff delays
- **Alerting criteria**:
  - Individual endpoint failure rate >20%
  - Sequential processing timeout (>8 minutes)
  - Rate limiting frequency >50% of API calls
  - Response validation failure rate >10%

#### Open Questions
- None - all requirements clarified

#### Notes
Focus on creating robust sequential processing that can handle individual endpoint failures gracefully. The rate limiting is critical to prevent API quota exhaustion. Ensure the partial success tracking provides clear visibility into which endpoints succeeded and failed for operational troubleshooting.
