# Ticket 3.2.3: Asset Selection Logic and Batch Processing

### Estimate
3 hours

**Status**: Refinement Complete

#### Description
Implement asset selection logic with configurable batch size that chooses the appropriate number of high-priority assets for regular pollination. This includes batch processing capabilities, selection thresholds, and efficient handling of multiple assets for event dispatch.

#### Technical Details
- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. Create `src/selection/asset-selection/` directory structure
  2. Implement `AssetSelectionLogic` class for asset selection
  3. Create `selectAssetsForPollenation(assets: AssetRecord[], batchSize: number): AssetRecord[]` method
  4. Implement `AssetSelectionConfig` interface with configurable parameters:
     - defaultBatchSize: number (default 25)
     - maxBatchSize: number (default 50)
     - minPriorityScore: number (default 0.3)
     - selectionStrategy: 'top-n' | 'threshold-based' | 'hybrid'
  5. Create `BatchProcessor` class for batch processing
  6. Implement `processAssetBatch(assets: AssetRecord[], batchSize: number): AssetBatch[]` method
  7. Create `AssetBatch` interface with batch metadata:
     - batchId: string
     - assets: AssetRecord[]
     - priorityScore: number
     - batchSize: number
  8. Create `SelectionThresholdManager` class for threshold management
  9. Implement `applySelectionThresholds(assets: AssetRecord[], config: AssetSelectionConfig): AssetRecord[]` method
  10. Create `BatchOptimizer` class for batch optimization
  11. Implement `optimizeBatchSize(assets: AssetRecord[], targetCount: number): number` method
  12. Create `AssetSelectionValidator` class for selection validation
  13. Implement `validateAssetSelection(selected: AssetRecord[], total: AssetRecord[]): ValidationResult` method
  14. Add comprehensive unit tests for all selection scenarios
  15. Create selection performance monitoring and logging

- **Architecture Considerations**:
  - Asset selection logic is configurable and extensible
  - Batch processing handles multiple assets efficiently
  - Selection thresholds ensure quality asset selection
  - Batch optimization balances selection quality and processing efficiency
  - Selection validation ensures data integrity

- **Security Requirements**:
  - Asset selection doesn't expose sensitive financial data
  - Selection parameters are validated to prevent manipulation
  - Batch processing handles data securely

- **Performance Requirements**:
  - Asset selection completes within 5 seconds for 1000 assets
  - Batch processing completes within 2 seconds per batch
  - Selection validation completes within 1 second
  - Memory usage scales appropriately with asset count

#### Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**:
  - Task3.2-Ticket1: Core Lambda Function Structure and DynamoDB GSI Query Logic
  - Task3.2-Ticket2: Priority Scoring Algorithm Implementation
- **Dependent Tickets**:
  - Task3.2-Ticket4: EventBridge Integration and CloudWatch Metrics

#### Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**:
  - Test asset selection logic with various batch sizes and thresholds
  - Test batch processing with different asset counts and configurations
  - Test selection thresholds with various priority score distributions
  - Test batch optimization with different target counts
  - Test selection validation with valid/invalid selections
  - Test edge cases: empty asset lists, single assets, very large datasets
  - Test coverage target: >90%

- **Integration Tests**:
  - Test asset selection with actual scored asset data
  - Verify batch processing performance with realistic asset volumes
  - Test selection integration with priority scoring algorithm

- **Performance Tests**:
  - Measure asset selection performance (1000 assets <5 seconds)
  - Test batch processing performance (<2 seconds per batch)
  - Verify selection validation performance (<1 second)

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Asset selection logic chooses appropriate number of high-priority assets
- [ ] Batch processing handles multiple assets efficiently with configurable batch sizes
- [ ] Selection thresholds ensure quality asset selection based on priority scores
- [ ] Batch optimization balances selection quality and processing efficiency
- [ ] Asset selection validation ensures data integrity and selection quality
- [ ] Selection logic is configurable with different strategies and parameters
- [ ] Batch processing provides clear metadata for downstream processing
- [ ] All unit tests pass with >90% coverage
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met (selection <5s, batch <2s, validation <1s)
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Selection logic documentation provides clear implementation details

#### Error Handling
- Invalid asset data triggers appropriate error handling
- Selection failures provide clear error messages
- Batch processing errors are handled gracefully
- Selection validation errors provide actionable feedback

#### Monitoring and Observability
- Asset selection performance metrics
- Batch processing efficiency and timing
- Selection threshold effectiveness tracking
- Priority score distribution in selected assets
- Selection validation success rates and error types

#### Open Questions
- None - all asset selection requirements are clear

#### Notes
Focus on creating efficient, configurable asset selection logic that provides quality asset selection while maintaining good performance. The selection should balance the need for comprehensive coverage with processing efficiency. Consider that the selection may need to be tuned based on actual usage patterns and system performance requirements.
