# Ticket 3.4.1: MarkEarningsProcessed Lambda Function Core Implementation

### Estimate
2.5 hours

**Status**: Refinement Complete

#### Description
Implement the core MarkEarningsProcessed Lambda function with event processing, payload validation, and DynamoDB update operations. This ticket establishes the foundational framework for the earnings status update function, including event handling, data validation, and basic error handling infrastructure.

#### Technical Details
- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. Create Lambda function handler with TypeScript structure
  2. Implement earningsProcessed event processing and validation
  3. Create event payload validation for required fields (asset_symbol, earnings_date)
  4. Implement DynamoDB update operations for earningsCalendar table
  5. Create status field update logic (mark as processed)
  6. Implement basic error handling and retry logic for DynamoDB operations
  7. Set up CloudWatch metrics emission for processing tracking
  8. Create TypeScript interfaces for earningsProcessed event payload
  9. Implement idempotency check to prevent duplicate processing

- **Architecture Considerations**:
  - Function integrates with EventBridge for earningsProcessed event processing
  - Uses DynamoDB for earningsCalendar table updates
  - Implements simple, focused status update pattern
  - Designed for 128MB memory and 30-second timeout configuration

- **Security Requirements**:
  - Input validation for event payloads to prevent injection attacks
  - Secure handling of earnings data in logs
  - Proper error handling to prevent data exposure

- **Performance Requirements**:
  - DynamoDB update operations complete within 10 seconds
  - Efficient memory usage for simple status updates
  - CloudWatch metrics for performance monitoring

#### Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**:
  - Task 3.1: TriggerEarningsPollenation Lambda Function Implementation (generates earningsProcessed events)
  - earningsCalendar DynamoDB table operational and accessible
  - EventBridge custom event rules configured for earningsProcessed events
- **Dependent Tickets**:
  - Task 3.4-Ticket2: Error Handling and Monitoring Enhancement

#### Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**:
  - Event payload validation testing with various earningsProcessed event formats
  - DynamoDB update operation testing with mocked responses
  - Idempotency testing with duplicate event scenarios
  - Error handling testing for DynamoDB update failures
  - Event processing testing with valid/invalid payloads
  - CloudWatch metrics emission testing

- **Integration Tests**:
  - End-to-end event processing from EventBridge
  - DynamoDB integration testing with real table operations
  - EventBridge event flow validation

- **Performance Tests**:
  - DynamoDB update operation performance
  - Memory usage under various event payload sizes
  - Function execution time validation within 30-second timeout

- **Security Tests**:
  - Input validation for malicious event payloads
  - DynamoDB access validation
  - Error message security testing

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Lambda function successfully processes earningsProcessed events
- [ ] Event payload validation correctly handles required fields (asset_symbol, earnings_date)
- [ ] DynamoDB update operations correctly mark earnings as processed in earningsCalendar table
- [ ] Idempotency check prevents duplicate processing of same earnings
- [ ] Basic error handling manages DynamoDB update failures gracefully
- [ ] CloudWatch metrics emit for processing success/failure tracking
- [ ] TypeScript interfaces defined for earningsProcessed event payload
- [ ] All unit tests pass with >90% coverage
- [ ] Integration tests validate EventBridge event processing
- [ ] Security tests pass for input validation and error handling
- [ ] Function completes execution within 30-second timeout

#### Error Handling
- Invalid event payloads: Return 400 error with validation details, log error
- DynamoDB update failures: Retry with exponential backoff, log detailed error
- Missing required fields: Return 400 error, log validation failure
- Idempotency violations: Log warning, skip processing, emit metrics
- CloudWatch metrics emission failures: Log warning but continue processing
- DynamoDB access failures: Log error and fail gracefully

#### Monitoring and Observability
- **Metrics to track**:
  - Event processing success/failure rates
  - DynamoDB update success/failure rates
  - Idempotency violation frequency
  - Processing time for status updates
  - Event payload validation failure rates
- **Logging requirements**:
  - Event payload details (sanitized)
  - DynamoDB update operation results
  - Idempotency check results
  - Error details with stack traces
  - Processing performance metrics
- **Alerting criteria**:
  - Event processing failure rate >10%
  - DynamoDB update failure rate >15%
  - Processing timeout (>30 seconds)
  - Idempotency violation rate >20%

#### Open Questions
- None - all requirements clarified

#### Notes
Focus on creating a simple, reliable function that handles the single responsibility of earnings status updates. The idempotency check is critical to prevent duplicate processing. Ensure robust error handling as this function will be called frequently in the event-driven workflow.
