  - Monitoring access patterns and security events
- **Logging requirements**:
  - Dashboard configuration and setup logs
  - Alert configuration and testing logs
  - Metric validation and accuracy logs
  - Monitoring access control and security logs
  - Dashboard usage and performance logs
- **Alerting criteria**:
  - Dashboard loading failures >10%
  - Alert notification delivery failures >15%
  - Monitoring system performance degradation >20%
  - Metric collection failures >10%
  - Monitoring access control violations

#### Open Questions
- None - all requirements clarified

#### Notes
