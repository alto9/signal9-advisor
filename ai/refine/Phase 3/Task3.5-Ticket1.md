### Estimate
3 hours

**Status**: Refinement Complete

#### Description
Implement comprehensive end-to-end testing for both earnings-triggered and regular pollination workflows. This ticket focuses on validating the complete event flow from trigger functions through data processing and storage, ensuring the dual pollination strategy works correctly in isolation and under various scenarios.

#### Technical Details
- **Implementation Steps**:

  2. Implement earnings-triggered pollination workflow testing
  3. Implement regular pollination workflow testing
  4. Create test data generation for realistic asset scenarios
  5. Implement event flow validation for pollenationNeeded → PollenateAsset → data storage
  6. Implement event flow validation for earningsProcessed → MarkEarningsProcessed
  7. Create test scenarios for various asset types and data volumes
  8. Implement workflow completion validation and data verification
  9. Create test reporting and result documentation
  10. Implement cleanup procedures for test environment

  - End-to-end processing time for each workflow type
  - Test execution time and resource usage
  - Data validation success/failure rates
  - Test environment resource utilization
- **Logging requirements**:
  - Detailed workflow execution logs with step-by-step validation
  - Test data generation and validation results
  - Event flow validation details and timing
  - Error details with stack traces for failed workflows
  - Test environment setup and cleanup logs
- **Alerting criteria**:
  - Workflow completion failure rate >10%
  - Test execution timeout (>expected timeframes)
  - Data validation failure rate >15%
  - Test environment resource exhaustion

#### Open Questions
- None - all requirements clarified

#### Notes
