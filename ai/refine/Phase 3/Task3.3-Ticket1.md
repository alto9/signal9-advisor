# Ticket 3.3.1: PollenateAsset Lambda Function Core Structure and AlphaVantage Integration Setup

### Estimate
6 hours

**Status**: Refinement Complete

#### Description
Implement the core structure of the PollenateAsset Lambda function with AlphaVantage API integration setup. This ticket establishes the foundational framework for the comprehensive financial data collection function, including event processing, API client setup, and basic error handling infrastructure.

#### Technical Details
- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. Create Lambda function handler with TypeScript structure
  2. Implement pollenationNeeded event processing and validation
  3. Set up AlphaVantage API client with authentication from Secrets Manager
  4. Create API endpoint configuration for all 5 fundamental data endpoints
  5. Implement basic error handling and retry logic for API calls
  6. Set up CloudWatch metrics emission for API call tracking
  7. Create TypeScript interfaces for AlphaVantage API responses
  8. Implement event context processing (earnings vs. regular trigger differentiation)

- **Architecture Considerations**:
  - Function integrates with EventBridge for pollenationNeeded event processing
  - Uses AWS Secrets Manager for AlphaVantage API key management
  - Implements modular API client pattern for maintainability
  - Designed for 1024MB memory and 10-minute timeout configuration

- **Security Requirements**:
  - API credentials stored in AWS Secrets Manager
  - Input validation for event payloads to prevent injection attacks
  - Secure handling of financial data in memory and logs

- **Performance Requirements**:
  - API call timeout configuration (30 seconds per endpoint)
  - Efficient memory usage for large response processing
  - CloudWatch metrics for performance monitoring

#### Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**:
  - Task 3.1: TriggerEarningsPollenation Lambda Function Implementation
  - Task 3.2: TriggerRegularPollenation Lambda Function Implementation
  - AlphaVantage API credentials configured in Secrets Manager
  - EventBridge custom event rules configured
- **Dependent Tickets**:
  - Task 3.3-Ticket2: Sequential API Call Implementation
  - Task 3.3-Ticket3: Bulk Data Processing and Validation

#### Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**:
  - Event payload validation testing with various pollenationNeeded event formats
  - AlphaVantage API client initialization and authentication testing
  - Event context processing testing (earnings vs. regular trigger)
  - Error handling testing for API authentication failures
  - Mock AlphaVantage API responses for all 5 endpoints

- **Integration Tests**:
  - End-to-end event processing from EventBridge
  - Secrets Manager integration testing
  - CloudWatch metrics emission validation

- **Performance Tests**:
  - API client initialization performance
  - Memory usage under various event payload sizes

- **Security Tests**:
  - Input validation for malicious event payloads
  - Secrets Manager access validation
  - API credential security testing

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Lambda function successfully processes pollenationNeeded events from both trigger sources
- [ ] AlphaVantage API client initializes correctly with Secrets Manager credentials
- [ ] Event context processing correctly differentiates earnings vs. regular triggers
- [ ] Basic error handling manages API authentication and connection failures
- [ ] CloudWatch metrics emit for API call attempts and authentication status
- [ ] TypeScript interfaces defined for all AlphaVantage API response types
- [ ] All unit tests pass with >90% coverage
- [ ] Integration tests validate EventBridge event processing
- [ ] Security tests pass for input validation and credential handling
- [ ] Function structure supports modular expansion for sequential API calls

#### Error Handling
- API authentication failures: Retry with exponential backoff, log detailed error
- Invalid event payloads: Return 400 error with validation details
- Secrets Manager access failures: Log error and fail gracefully
- Event context parsing errors: Default to regular trigger context
- CloudWatch metrics emission failures: Log warning but continue processing

#### Monitoring and Observability
- **Metrics to track**:
  - Event processing success/failure rates
  - API authentication success/failure rates
  - Event context distribution (earnings vs. regular)
  - Function initialization time
- **Logging requirements**:
  - Event payload details (sanitized)
  - API client initialization status
  - Error details with stack traces
  - Event context processing results
- **Alerting criteria**:
  - API authentication failure rate >10%
  - Event processing failure rate >5%

#### Open Questions
- None - all requirements clarified

#### Notes
Focus on creating a solid foundation that can be easily extended for sequential API calls. Ensure the API client pattern is modular and testable. Pay special attention to error handling as this will be critical for the complex sequential processing in subsequent tickets.
