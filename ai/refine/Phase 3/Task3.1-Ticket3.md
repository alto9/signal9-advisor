# Ticket 3.1.3: CloudWatch Metrics and Error Handling Integration

### Estimate
2 hours

**Status**: Refinement Complete

#### Description
Implement comprehensive CloudWatch metrics and error handling for the TriggerEarningsPollenation Lambda function. This includes metrics for event dispatch tracking and success rates, error handling with retry logic, and integration with the established error handling framework from Phase 2.

#### Technical Details
- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. Create `src/monitoring/trigger-earnings/` directory structure
  2. Implement `TriggerEarningsMetrics` class for CloudWatch metrics
  3. Create `recordEarningsQueryMetrics(earningsCount: number, queryTime: number): void` method
  4. Implement `recordEventDispatchMetrics(eventType: string, success: boolean, dispatchTime: number): void` method
  5. Create `recordProcessingMetrics(assetsProcessed: number, totalTime: number): void` method
  6. Implement `ErrorHandler` class for error handling integration
  7. Create `handleDynamoDBError(error: Error, context: string): Promise<void>` method
  8. Implement `handleEventBridgeError(error: Error, eventType: string): Promise<void>` method
  9. Create `handleValidationError(error: Error, data: any): Promise<void>` method
  10. Implement `RetryHandler` class for retry logic integration
  11. Create `retryWithBackoff<T>(operation: () => Promise<T>, maxRetries: number): Promise<T>` method
  12. Add comprehensive unit tests for all monitoring scenarios
  13. Create monitoring dashboard configuration and alerting setup
  14. Integrate with Phase 2 error handling framework

- **Architecture Considerations**:
  - CloudWatch metrics follow established naming conventions
  - Error handling integrates with Phase 2 error handling framework
  - Retry logic uses exponential backoff patterns
  - Metrics provide operational visibility for earnings-triggered pollination
  - Error handling provides detailed logging for troubleshooting

- **Security Requirements**:
  - CloudWatch metrics don't expose sensitive earnings data
  - Error logs are sanitized to prevent data leakage
  - Retry logic doesn't expose internal system details
  - Monitoring data follows security best practices

- **Performance Requirements**:
  - Metrics recording adds <10ms overhead per operation
  - Error handling completes within 50ms per error
  - Retry logic adds <100ms overhead per retry attempt
  - Monitoring integration doesn't impact Lambda performance

#### Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**:
  - Task3.1-Ticket1: Core Lambda Function Structure and DynamoDB Query Logic
  - Task3.1-Ticket2: Event Payload Construction and EventBridge Integration
  - Phase 2 error handling framework established
- **Dependent Tasks**:
  - Task 3.2: TriggerRegularPollenation Lambda Function Implementation

#### Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**:
  - Test CloudWatch metrics recording with various scenarios
  - Test error handling with different error types
  - Test retry logic with various failure scenarios
  - Test monitoring integration with Phase 2 framework
  - Test edge cases: null metrics, invalid errors, retry exhaustion
  - Test coverage target: >90%

- **Integration Tests**:
  - Test CloudWatch metrics integration with actual CloudWatch service
  - Verify error handling integration with Phase 2 framework
  - Test retry logic with realistic failure conditions

- **Performance Tests**:
  - Measure metrics recording overhead (<10ms per operation)
  - Test error handling performance (<50ms per error)
  - Verify retry logic overhead (<100ms per retry)

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] CloudWatch metrics provide visibility into event dispatch volume and success rates
- [ ] Error handling integrates seamlessly with Phase 2 error handling framework
- [ ] Retry logic provides reliable recovery from transient failures
- [ ] Metrics recording includes comprehensive operational data
- [ ] Error handling provides detailed logging for operational troubleshooting
- [ ] Monitoring dashboard configuration provides clear operational visibility
- [ ] Alerting setup identifies critical failures and performance issues
- [ ] All unit tests pass with >90% coverage
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met (metrics <10ms, errors <50ms, retry <100ms)
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Monitoring documentation provides clear operational procedures

#### Error Handling
- DynamoDB query errors trigger appropriate retry logic
- EventBridge dispatch errors are handled with exponential backoff
- Validation errors provide clear error messages for debugging
- Error handling integrates with established Phase 2 patterns

#### Monitoring and Observability
- Earnings query performance and success rates
- Event dispatch volume and success rates by event type
- Error rates and types for different operation categories
- Retry attempt frequency and success rates
- Lambda function execution timing and resource usage
- Operational alerting and notification metrics

#### Open Questions
- None - all monitoring and error handling requirements are clear

#### Notes
Focus on creating comprehensive monitoring and error handling that provides clear operational visibility for the earnings-triggered pollination process. The monitoring should integrate seamlessly with the Phase 2 error handling framework while providing specific insights into earnings processing performance. Consider that this function is part of a larger event-driven system and monitoring should support end-to-end visibility.
