  6. Document operational capacity assessment
  7. Set up performance trend monitoring
  8. Validate all Phase 4 exit criteria
  9. Document performance observations for operational teams
  10. Implement final project completion validation

#### Open Questions
- None - all requirements clarified

#### Notes
This ticket serves as the final validation gate for the entire project. Focus on ensuring all end-to-end workflows function reliably under production conditions and establishing comprehensive performance baselines for ongoing operational monitoring. The end-to-end workflow testing should validate complete system functionality, while performance baseline documentation should support ongoing operational excellence. All Phase 4 exit criteria must be validated and confirmed before project completion. Document any performance observations for operational teams to support ongoing system management.
