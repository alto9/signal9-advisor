# Ticket 4.3.2: Automated Alerting Configuration

### Estimate
5 hours

**Status**: Refinement Complete

#### Description
Implement comprehensive automated alerting configuration for critical system failures, performance degradation, and data quality issues. This ticket focuses on creating alert thresholds, configuring SNS notifications, and establishing alert documentation and escalation procedures for operational teams.

#### Technical Details
- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. Configure automated alerting for critical system failures (Lambda errors, DynamoDB throttling)
  2. Implement performance degradation alerting (execution timeouts, high latency)
  3. Create data quality issue alerting (validation failures, API rate limits)
  4. Set up business metric alerts (pollination success rates, data freshness)
  5. Configure SNS topic configuration for alert notifications
  6. Implement alert threshold testing and calibration
  7. Create alert documentation and escalation procedures
  8. Set up alert testing and validation procedures
  9. Implement alert performance optimization and monitoring
  10. Create alert handover documentation for operational teams

- **Architecture Considerations**:
  - Automated alerting provides proactive issue identification and resolution
  - Alert thresholds balance sensitivity with false positive prevention
  - SNS notifications ensure timely alert delivery to operational teams
  - Alert escalation procedures enable effective incident response

- **Security Requirements**:
  - Alert notifications secure and don't expose sensitive system information
  - Alert escalation procedures include security incident response
  - Alert configuration follows security best practices
  - SNS topic configuration secure and properly access-controlled

- **Performance Requirements**:
  - Alert delivery completes within 1 minute of trigger
  - Alert threshold evaluation efficient and doesn't impact system performance
  - SNS notification delivery reliable and timely
  - Alert escalation procedures execute within defined timeframes

#### Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**:
  - Task 4.3-Ticket1: CloudWatch Dashboard Creation and Configuration
  - CloudWatch metrics and custom metrics operational
- **Dependent Tickets**:
  - Task 4.3-Ticket3: Notification Systems and Monitoring Validation

#### Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**:
  - Alert threshold configuration testing with various scenarios
  - SNS notification configuration testing
  - Alert escalation procedure testing
  - Alert performance testing

- **Integration Tests**:
  - End-to-end alerting integration testing with CloudWatch
  - SNS notification integration testing
  - Alert escalation integration testing
  - Alert threshold integration testing

- **Performance Tests**:
  - Alert delivery performance testing
  - Alert threshold evaluation performance testing
  - SNS notification delivery performance testing
  - Alert escalation performance testing

- **Security Tests**:
  - Alert notification security testing
  - Alert escalation security validation
  - SNS topic configuration security testing

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Automated alerting configured for critical system failures (Lambda errors, DynamoDB throttling)
- [ ] Performance degradation alerting operational (execution timeouts, high latency)
- [ ] Data quality issue alerting functional (validation failures, API rate limits)
- [ ] Business metric alerts operational (pollination success rates, data freshness)
- [ ] SNS topic configuration properly set up for alert notifications
- [ ] Alert threshold testing and calibration completed
- [ ] Alert documentation and escalation procedures comprehensive
- [ ] Alert testing and validation procedures operational
- [ ] Alert performance optimization and monitoring implemented
- [ ] Alert handover documentation comprehensive for operational teams
- [ ] Alert delivery completes within 1 minute of trigger
- [ ] Alert threshold evaluation efficient and doesn't impact system performance
- [ ] SNS notification delivery reliable and timely
- [ ] Alert escalation procedures execute within defined timeframes
- [ ] All alert configurations follow security best practices
- [ ] Alert thresholds properly balance sensitivity with false positive prevention

#### Error Handling
- Alert configuration failures: Log configuration errors, provide manual alert setup procedures
- SNS notification failures: Implement notification fallback, log notification errors
- Alert threshold failures: Implement threshold validation, log threshold errors
- Alert escalation failures: Implement escalation fallback, log escalation errors
- Alert performance failures: Implement performance optimization, log performance issues

#### Monitoring and Observability
- **Metrics to track**:
  - Alert delivery success/failure rates
  - Alert threshold evaluation performance
  - SNS notification delivery success rates
  - Alert escalation execution success rates
  - False positive alert rates and calibration effectiveness
- **Logging requirements**:
  - Alert configuration logs and setup details
  - SNS notification delivery logs and results
  - Alert threshold evaluation logs and calibration results
  - Alert escalation execution logs and results
  - Alert performance logs and optimization results
- **Alerting criteria**:
  - Alert delivery failure rate >10%
  - SNS notification delivery failure rate >15%
  - Alert threshold evaluation failures >5%
  - Alert escalation execution failures >10%

#### Open Questions
- None - all requirements clarified

#### Notes
Focus on creating actionable alerting that provides clear insights for operational teams while avoiding alert fatigue. The alert thresholds should be well-calibrated to catch genuine issues without generating excessive false positives. Ensure SNS notifications deliver alerts reliably and timely to appropriate operational teams.
