# Ticket 4.6.1: System Performance Validation and Metrics Verification

### Estimate
3 hours

**Status**: Refinement Complete

#### Description
Conduct comprehensive system performance validation and metrics verification in the production environment to ensure all performance targets are achieved. This ticket focuses on validating system uptime, Lambda execution times, event processing latency, and API response times to meet specified performance targets.

#### Technical Details
- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. Validate system uptime >99% over extended testing period
  2. Test Lambda execution time validation (within timeout limits)
  3. Verify event processing latency validation (<30 seconds)
  4. Validate API response time validation (<30 seconds)
  5. Implement system performance metrics collection and monitoring
  6. Test Lambda function performance under production loads
  7. Validate event processing performance across all workflows
  8. Test API integration performance with production data
  9. Establish performance baseline measurements
  10. Implement performance trend monitoring and alerting

- **Architecture Considerations**:
  - System performance validation ensures >99% uptime over testing period
  - Lambda execution time validation confirms functions within timeout limits
  - Event processing latency validation ensures <30 second processing times

- **Alerting criteria**:
  - System uptime <99% for >5 minutes
  - Lambda execution timeout rate >10%
  - Event processing latency >30 seconds
  - API response time >30 seconds
  - Performance monitoring failure rate >10%

#### Open Questions
- None - all requirements clarified

#### Notes
This ticket serves as the foundation for comprehensive performance validation. Focus on establishing accurate performance baselines and ensuring all performance metrics meet specified targets. The system performance validation should be conducted over an extended testing period to ensure consistent achievement of >99% uptime and all other performance targets. Performance monitoring should be efficient and not impact system operations.
