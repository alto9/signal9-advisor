# Ticket 4.6.2: Data Quality Validation and Collection Reliability Testing

### Estimate
3 hours

**Status**: Refinement Complete

#### Description
Validate data quality and collection reliability under production conditions to ensure all data quality metrics meet specified targets. This ticket focuses on validating data validation success rates, API integration success rates, scheduled job completion rates, and data freshness requirements.

#### Technical Details
- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. Validate data validation success rate measurement (>95% target)
  2. Test API integration success rate validation (>98% target)
  3. Verify scheduled job completion rate validation (100% target)
  4. Validate data freshness validation (<24 hours regular, <4 hours earnings)
  5. Implement data quality metrics collection and monitoring
  6. Test data validation processes under production conditions
  7. Validate API integration reliability with production data
  8. Test scheduled job reliability and completion tracking
  9. Validate data freshness monitoring and alerting
  10. Establish data quality baseline measurements

- **Architecture Considerations**:
  - Data quality validation ensures >95% success rate consistently
  - API integration validation confirms >98% success rate for Alpaca and AlphaVantage
  - Scheduled job validation ensures 100% completion rate
  - Data freshness validation confirms <24 hours regular, <4 hours earnings
  - Data quality baseline establishment supports ongoing monitoring

- **Security Requirements**:
  - Data quality validation includes data security verification
  - API integration validation includes credential security verification
  - Scheduled job validation includes execution security verification
  - Data freshness validation includes data integrity verification
  - Data quality monitoring includes security metric collection

- **Performance Requirements**:
  - Data validation success rate consistently >95%
  - API integration success rate >98% for all integrations
  - Scheduled job completion rate 100% within designated time windows
  - Data freshness validation efficient and accurate
  - Data quality monitoring doesn't impact data collection performance

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Data validation success rate consistently >95%
- [ ] API integration success rate >98% for Alpaca and AlphaVantage
- [ ] Scheduled job completion rate validation (100% target) achieved
- [ ] Data freshness validation (<24 hours regular, <4 hours earnings) successful
- [ ] Data quality metrics collection and monitoring operational
- [ ] Data validation processes under production conditions validated
- [ ] API integration reliability with production data confirmed
- [ ] Scheduled job reliability and completion tracking functional
- [ ] Data freshness monitoring and alerting operational
- [ ] Data quality baseline measurements established
- [ ] All data quality validation follows security best practices
- [ ] Data validation success rate consistently >95%
- [ ] API integration success rate >98% for all integrations
- [ ] Scheduled job completion rate 100% within designated time windows
- [ ] Data freshness validation efficient and accurate
- [ ] Data quality monitoring doesn't impact data collection performance
- [ ] All data quality metrics meet specified targets

#### Error Handling
- Data validation failures: Implement validation fallback, log validation errors
- API integration failures: Implement integration fallback, log integration errors
- Scheduled job failures: Implement job retry logic, log job completion errors
- Data freshness failures: Implement freshness monitoring fallback, log freshness errors
- Data quality monitoring failures: Implement monitoring fallback, log monitoring errors

#### Monitoring and Observability
- **Metrics to track**:
  - Data validation success/failure rates
  - API integration success/failure rates
  - Scheduled job completion rates and timing
  - Data freshness measurements and trends
  - Data quality monitoring system health
- **Logging requirements**:
  - Data validation logs and success rates
  - API integration logs and success rates
  - Scheduled job completion logs and timing
  - Data freshness validation logs and measurements
  - Data quality monitoring logs and alerts
- **Alerting criteria**:
  - Data validation success rate <95% for >1 hour
  - API integration success rate <98% for >30 minutes
  - Scheduled job completion rate <100% for any job
  - Data freshness >24 hours regular or >4 hours earnings
  - Data quality monitoring failure rate >10%

#### Open Questions
- None - all requirements clarified

#### Notes
Focus on validating data quality and collection reliability under production conditions. The data quality validation should ensure consistent achievement of >95% success rates, while API integration validation should confirm >98% success rates for all integrations. Scheduled job validation should ensure 100% completion rate within designated time windows, and data freshness validation should confirm data is current and accurate. Data quality monitoring should be efficient and not impact data collection performance.
