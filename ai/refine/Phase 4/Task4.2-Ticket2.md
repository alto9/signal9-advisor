# Ticket 4.2.2: Production Deployment and Tag-Based Releases

### Estimate
5 hours

**Status**: Refinement Complete

#### Description
Implement tag-based production deployment workflow with comprehensive validation gates and production environment configuration. This ticket focuses on creating reliable production deployment processes, environment-specific configurations, and deployment validation for production releases.

#### Technical Details
- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. Configure tag-based production deployment workflow
  2. Implement production environment-specific deployment configuration
  3. Create comprehensive deployment validation gates for production
  4. Set up production AWS credentials and permissions management
  5. Implement deployment approval and gating mechanisms
  6. Create production health checks and validation procedures
  7. Set up production deployment notifications and status reporting
  8. Implement deployment rollback triggers and monitoring
  9. Create production deployment testing and validation procedures
  10. Implement deployment documentation and operational procedures

- **Architecture Considerations**:
  - Tag-based deployment ensures controlled production releases
  - Production environment configuration provides proper isolation
  - Deployment validation gates prevent faulty production releases
  - Production health checks ensure deployment success validation

- **Security Requirements**:
  - Production AWS credentials managed with enhanced security
  - Deployment approval mechanisms prevent unauthorized production deployments
  - Production environment isolation from staging and development
  - Deployment rollback capabilities for security incident response

- **Performance Requirements**:
  - Production deployment completes within 20 minutes
  - Deployment validation gates provide rapid feedback
  - Health checks validate production deployment within 5 minutes
  - Rollback procedures execute within 10 minutes

#### Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**:
  - Task 4.2-Ticket1: GitHub Actions Workflow Configuration and Basic CI/CD Setup
  - AWS production environment properly configured
  - Production deployment approval processes established
- **Dependent Tickets**:
  - Task 4.2-Ticket3: Rollback Procedures and Pipeline Validation

#### Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**:
  - Tag-based deployment workflow testing
  - Production environment configuration testing
  - Deployment validation gate testing
  - Production health check testing

- **Integration Tests**:
  - End-to-end production deployment testing with mock tags
  - Production deployment validation integration testing
  - Deployment approval mechanism integration testing
  - Production health check integration testing

- **Performance Tests**:
  - Production deployment performance testing
  - Deployment validation performance testing
  - Health check performance validation

- **Security Tests**:
  - Production credential management security testing
  - Deployment approval security validation
  - Production environment isolation testing

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Tag-based production deployment workflow configured and operational
- [ ] Production environment-specific deployment configuration properly implemented
- [ ] Comprehensive deployment validation gates prevent faulty production releases
- [ ] Production AWS credentials and permissions managed securely
- [ ] Deployment approval and gating mechanisms operational
- [ ] Production health checks and validation procedures functional
- [ ] Production deployment notifications provide clear status information
- [ ] Deployment rollback triggers and monitoring operational
- [ ] Production deployment testing and validation procedures documented
- [ ] Deployment documentation and operational procedures comprehensive
- [ ] Production deployment completes within 20 minutes
- [ ] Deployment validation gates provide rapid feedback (<5 minutes)
- [ ] Health checks validate production deployment within 5 minutes
- [ ] Rollback procedures execute within 10 minutes
- [ ] All production deployment configurations follow security best practices

#### Error Handling
- Production deployment failures: Log deployment errors, trigger rollback procedures
- Deployment validation failures: Log validation errors, prevent deployment progression
- Production health check failures: Log health check errors, trigger rollback if necessary
- Credential management failures: Log credential errors, prevent deployment execution
- Approval mechanism failures: Log approval errors, prevent unauthorized deployments

#### Monitoring and Observability
- **Metrics to track**:
  - Production deployment success/failure rates
  - Deployment validation gate success rates
  - Production health check success rates
  - Deployment approval process efficiency
  - Rollback trigger frequency and success rates
- **Logging requirements**:
  - Production deployment execution logs and results
  - Deployment validation gate execution logs and results
  - Production health check execution logs and results
  - Deployment approval process logs and audit trail
  - Rollback trigger logs and execution results
- **Alerting criteria**:
  - Production deployment failure rate >10%
  - Deployment validation gate failure rate >15%
  - Production health check failure rate >5%
  - Deployment approval process failures
  - Rollback trigger frequency >20% of deployments

#### Open Questions
- None - all requirements clarified

#### Notes
Focus on creating reliable, secure production deployment processes that minimize risk of production issues. The tag-based deployment strategy ensures controlled releases, while comprehensive validation gates prevent faulty deployments. Ensure proper security practices for production credential management and deployment approval.
