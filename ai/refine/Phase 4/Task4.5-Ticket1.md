# Ticket 4.5.1: Production Deployment Execution and Infrastructure Validation

### Estimate
3 hours

**Status**: Refinement Complete

#### Description
Execute production deployment using the established CI/CD pipeline and validate all AWS infrastructure components are deployed and operational. This ticket focuses on the actual production deployment process and comprehensive infrastructure validation to ensure all AWS resources are properly configured and accessible.

#### Technical Details
- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. Execute production deployment using GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
  2. Validate all AWS infrastructure components deployed and operational
  3. Verify Lambda function deployment (all 7 functions deployed and executable)
  4. Validate DynamoDB tables accessible with proper permissions and configuration
  5. Confirm EventBridge rules trigger scheduled jobs correctly (Monday-Saturday)
  6. Test Lambda function execution and response validation
  7. Validate DynamoDB table permissions and configuration
  8. Confirm EventBridge scheduled rules operational
  9. Test custom EventBridge events operational
  10. Implement infrastructure health check validation

- **Architecture Considerations**:
  - Production deployment follows staged approach: Development → Testing → Staging → Tagging → Production
  - Infrastructure validation ensures all AWS resources properly configured
  - Lambda function validation confirms all 7 functions operational
  - DynamoDB validation ensures proper permissions and table configuration
  - EventBridge validation confirms scheduled rules and custom events operational

- **Security Requirements**:
  - Production deployment uses secure CI/CD pipeline with proper authentication
  - Infrastructure validation includes security configuration verification
  - Lambda function validation includes security permissions verification
  - DynamoDB validation includes access control and encryption verification
  - EventBridge validation includes security rule configuration verification

- **Performance Requirements**:
  - Production deployment completes within defined timeframes
  - Infrastructure validation efficient and doesn't impact system operations
  - Lambda function validation confirms execution within timeout limits
  - DynamoDB validation confirms proper performance configuration
  - EventBridge validation confirms rule execution efficiency

#### Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**:
  - Task 4.2: GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline Setup
  - Task 4.3: Advanced CloudWatch Monitoring and Alerting
  - Production AWS environment properly configured
- **Dependent Tickets**:

  - Task 4.5-Ticket3: Monitoring Validation and Performance Verification

#### Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**:
  - Production deployment success/failure testing
  - Infrastructure component validation testing
  - Lambda function deployment validation testing
  - DynamoDB configuration validation testing
  - EventBridge rule validation testing

- **Integration Tests**:
  - End-to-end production deployment validation
  - Infrastructure component integration testing
  - Lambda function integration testing
  - DynamoDB integration testing
  - EventBridge integration testing

- **Performance Tests**:
  - Production deployment performance testing
  - Infrastructure validation performance testing
  - Lambda function performance testing
  - DynamoDB performance testing
  - EventBridge performance testing

- **Security Tests**:
  - Production deployment security testing
  - Infrastructure security validation testing
  - Lambda function security testing
  - DynamoDB security testing
  - EventBridge security testing

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Production deployment completes successfully through CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] All AWS infrastructure components deployed and operational
- [ ] All 7 Lambda functions executable and responding correctly
- [ ] DynamoDB tables accessible with proper permissions and configuration
- [ ] EventBridge rules trigger scheduled jobs correctly (Monday-Saturday)
- [ ] Lambda function execution and response validation successful
- [ ] DynamoDB table permissions and configuration validated
- [ ] EventBridge scheduled rules operational and functional
- [ ] Custom EventBridge events operational and functional
- [ ] Infrastructure health check validation completed
- [ ] All infrastructure components follow security best practices
- [ ] Production deployment efficient and within defined timeframes
- [ ] Infrastructure validation doesn't impact system operations
- [ ] All Lambda functions execute within timeout limits
- [ ] DynamoDB performance configuration optimized
- [ ] EventBridge rule execution efficient and reliable

#### Error Handling
- Production deployment failures: Implement rollback procedures, log deployment errors
- Infrastructure validation failures: Implement validation fallback, log validation errors
- Lambda function failures: Implement function fallback, log function errors
- DynamoDB failures: Implement database fallback, log database errors
- EventBridge failures: Implement event fallback, log event errors

#### Monitoring and Observability
- **Metrics to track**:
  - Production deployment success/failure rates
  - Infrastructure component operational status
  - Lambda function deployment and execution status
  - DynamoDB table accessibility and performance
  - EventBridge rule execution status
- **Logging requirements**:
  - Production deployment execution logs and progress
  - Infrastructure validation logs and results
  - Lambda function validation logs and results
  - DynamoDB validation logs and results
  - EventBridge validation logs and results
- **Alerting criteria**:
  - Production deployment failure rate >10%
  - Infrastructure component failure rate >5%
  - Lambda function deployment failure rate >10%
  - DynamoDB accessibility failure rate >5%
  - EventBridge rule failure rate >10%

#### Open Questions
- None - all requirements clarified

#### Notes
Coordinate production deployment during maintenance window to minimize impact. Ensure rollback procedures are ready in case of deployment issues. Monitor system closely during initial production operation. The infrastructure validation should be comprehensive and ensure all AWS resources are properly configured and operational.
