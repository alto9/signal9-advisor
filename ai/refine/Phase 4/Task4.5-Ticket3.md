#### Open Questions
- None - all requirements clarified

#### Notes
Focus on validating monitoring and alerting systems in production and verifying performance metrics meet specified targets. The CloudWatch monitoring validation should ensure accurate production metrics display, while alert system validation should confirm appropriate response to test conditions. Performance metrics validation should ensure >95% success rates are achieved and all monitoring systems are operational and efficient.
