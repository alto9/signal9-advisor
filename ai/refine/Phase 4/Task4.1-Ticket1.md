# Ticket 4.1.1: Test Infrastructure Setup and Basic Lambda Function Testing

### Estimate
4 hours

**Status**: Refinement Complete

#### Description
Set up comprehensive test infrastructure with Jest and TypeScript, implement basic unit tests for simple Lambda functions, and establish foundational testing patterns. This ticket focuses on creating the testing foundation, Jest configuration, and implementing tests for the simpler Lambda functions (SyncAssets, SyncEarningsCalendar, SyncNewsSentiment).

#### Technical Details
- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. Set up Jest configuration with TypeScript support and coverage thresholds
  2. Create test infrastructure with proper directory structure and test utilities
  3. Implement comprehensive mocking for AWS SDK, DynamoDB, EventBridge, Secrets Manager
  4. Create test fixtures using actual API response data from models folders
  5. Implement unit tests for SyncAssets Lambda function
  6. Implement unit tests for SyncEarningsCalendar Lambda function
  7. Implement unit tests for SyncNewsSentiment Lambda function
  8. Set up automated coverage reporting and validation
  9. Create test utilities for common testing patterns
  10. Implement error scenario testing for basic failure modes

- **Architecture Considerations**:
  - Jest configuration supports TypeScript and enforces coverage thresholds
  - Mock implementations accurately simulate AWS service behaviors
  - Test fixtures use real API response structures for realistic testing
  - Test utilities provide reusable patterns for complex testing scenarios

- **Security Requirements**:
  - Test fixtures sanitized to prevent sensitive data exposure
  - Mock implementations secure and don't expose production credentials
  - Test environment isolated from production systems

- **Performance Requirements**:
  - Test suite executes within acceptable time limits (<2 minutes for basic functions)
  - Coverage reporting efficient and doesn't impact test execution
  - Mock implementations performant and don't slow test execution

#### Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**:
  - Phase 3: Event-Driven Processing completion
  - All Lambda functions implemented and operational
  - Access to API response models for test fixture creation
- **Dependent Tickets**:
  - Task 4.1-Ticket2: Event-Driven Lambda Function Testing
  - Task 4.1-Ticket3: Complex Data Processing Function Testing
  - Task 4.1-Ticket4: Coverage Validation and Test Optimization

#### Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**:
  - Jest configuration testing with TypeScript support
  - Mock implementation testing for AWS services
  - Test fixture validation against actual API responses
  - Basic Lambda function testing with edge cases
  - Error scenario testing for API failures and timeouts

- **Integration Tests**:
  - Test infrastructure integration testing
  - Coverage reporting integration testing
  - Mock behavior integration testing

- **Performance Tests**:
  - Test execution time validation
  - Coverage reporting performance testing
  - Mock implementation performance testing

- **Security Tests**:
  - Test fixture security validation
  - Mock implementation security testing
  - Test environment isolation validation

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Jest configuration properly set up with TypeScript support and coverage thresholds
- [ ] Test infrastructure provides comprehensive testing utilities and patterns
- [ ] Mock implementations correctly simulate AWS service behaviors
- [ ] Test fixtures accurately represent actual API response structures
- [ ] Unit tests implemented for SyncAssets with comprehensive coverage
- [ ] Unit tests implemented for SyncEarningsCalendar with comprehensive coverage
- [ ] Unit tests implemented for SyncNewsSentiment with comprehensive coverage
- [ ] Automated coverage reporting and validation operational
- [ ] Error scenario testing covers basic failure modes for all three functions
- [ ] Test suite executes within acceptable time limits (<2 minutes for basic functions)
- [ ] Coverage thresholds enforced automatically through Jest configuration
- [ ] Test utilities provide reusable patterns for complex testing scenarios
- [ ] All basic function tests pass with comprehensive coverage
- [ ] Mock implementations performant and don't slow test execution
- [ ] Test environment properly isolated from production systems

#### Error Handling
- Jest configuration failures: Log configuration errors, provide manual setup procedures
- Mock implementation failures: Implement fallback mock strategies, log mock errors
- Test fixture failures: Implement fixture validation, log fixture errors
- Coverage reporting failures: Implement basic coverage fallback, log reporting errors
- Test execution failures: Implement test isolation, log execution errors

#### Monitoring and Observability
- **Metrics to track**:
  - Test execution success/failure rates
  - Coverage reporting accuracy and completeness
  - Mock implementation reliability and performance
  - Test fixture validation success rates
  - Test execution time and performance trends
- **Logging requirements**:
  - Jest configuration setup and validation logs
  - Mock implementation behavior and performance logs
  - Test fixture creation and validation logs
  - Coverage reporting execution and results logs
  - Test execution performance and timing logs
- **Alerting criteria**:
  - Test execution failure rate >10%
  - Coverage reporting failure rate >15%
  - Mock implementation failure rate >5%
  - Test execution time >2 minutes for basic functions

#### Open Questions
- None - all requirements clarified

#### Notes
Focus on creating a solid testing foundation that can be easily extended for more complex functions. The mock implementations and test utilities will be critical for the more complex testing in subsequent tickets. Ensure test fixtures accurately represent real API responses for realistic testing.
