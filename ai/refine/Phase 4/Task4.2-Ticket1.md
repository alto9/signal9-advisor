# Ticket 4.2.1: GitHub Actions Workflow Configuration and Basic CI/CD Setup

### Estimate
4 hours

**Status**: Refinement Complete

#### Description
Set up foundational GitHub Actions workflow configuration for CI/CD pipeline with automated testing, CDK CLI integration, and basic deployment workflows. This ticket focuses on creating the core CI/CD infrastructure, pull request validation, and staging deployment workflows.

#### Technical Details
- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. Configure GitHub Actions workflow files for CI/CD pipeline
  2. Set up pull request validation workflow with unit tests and CDK diff
  3. Implement CDK CLI integration with proper AWS credentials and permissions
  4. Create staging deployment workflow for feature branch validation
  5. Configure environment-specific deployment configurations (dev, staging)
  6. Set up pipeline security with AWS credentials management
  7. Implement deployment validation gates with automated health checks
  8. Create deployment notifications and status reporting
  9. Set up workflow testing and validation procedures
  10. Implement basic rollback procedures for staging deployments

- **Architecture Considerations**:
  - GitHub Actions workflows provide automated CI/CD pipeline
  - CDK CLI integration enables infrastructure deployment automation
  - Environment-specific configurations ensure proper deployment isolation
  - Pipeline security manages AWS credentials securely

- **Security Requirements**:
  - AWS credentials managed securely through GitHub Secrets
  - Environment isolation prevents cross-environment contamination
  - Pipeline security prevents unauthorized deployments
  - Credential rotation and access control properly configured

- **Performance Requirements**:
  - Pull request validation completes within 10 minutes
  - Staging deployment completes within 15 minutes
  - CDK diff execution efficient and informative
  - Health checks provide rapid deployment validation

#### Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**:
  - Task 4.1: Comprehensive Unit Testing Implementation
  - GitHub repository setup with appropriate permissions
  - AWS staging environment configuration
- **Dependent Tickets**:
  - Task 4.2-Ticket2: Production Deployment and Tag-Based Releases
  - Task 4.2-Ticket3: Rollback Procedures and Pipeline Validation

#### Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**:
  - GitHub Actions workflow syntax validation
  - CDK CLI integration testing with mocked AWS responses
  - Credential management testing with secure practices
  - Environment configuration testing

- **Integration Tests**:
  - End-to-end CI/CD pipeline testing with feature branches
  - CDK deployment integration testing in staging environment
  - Pull request validation integration testing
  - Deployment notification integration testing

- **Performance Tests**:
  - Workflow execution time validation
  - CDK deployment performance testing
  - Health check performance validation

- **Security Tests**:
  - Credential management security validation
  - Environment isolation security testing
  - Pipeline security validation

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow files configured for CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Pull request validation workflow executes unit tests and CDK diff automatically
- [ ] CDK CLI integration configured with proper AWS credentials and permissions
- [ ] Staging deployment workflow operational for feature branch validation
- [ ] Environment-specific deployment configurations (dev, staging) properly configured
- [ ] Pipeline security properly manages AWS credentials through GitHub Secrets
- [ ] Deployment validation gates with automated health checks operational
- [ ] Deployment notifications provide clear status information
- [ ] Workflow testing and validation procedures documented and operational
- [ ] Basic rollback procedures implemented for staging deployments
- [ ] Pull request validation completes within 10 minutes
- [ ] Staging deployment completes within 15 minutes
- [ ] CDK diff execution provides clear infrastructure change information
- [ ] Health checks validate deployment success accurately
- [ ] All workflow configurations follow security best practices

#### Error Handling
- Workflow execution failures: Log workflow errors, provide manual execution procedures
- CDK deployment failures: Implement deployment validation, log deployment errors
- Credential management failures: Implement credential validation, log credential errors
- Health check failures: Implement health check validation, log health check errors
- Notification failures: Implement notification fallback, log notification errors

#### Monitoring and Observability
- **Metrics to track**:
  - Workflow execution success/failure rates
  - Pull request validation completion times
  - Staging deployment success rates and completion times
  - CDK deployment performance and success rates
  - Health check validation success rates
- **Logging requirements**:
  - Workflow execution logs and error details
  - CDK deployment logs and validation results
  - Credential management logs and security events
  - Health check execution logs and results
  - Deployment notification logs and delivery status
- **Alerting criteria**:
  - Workflow execution failure rate >15%
  - Pull request validation timeout (>10 minutes)
  - Staging deployment failure rate >20%
  - CDK deployment failure rate >15%
  - Health check failure rate >10%

#### Open Questions
- None - all requirements clarified

#### Notes
Focus on creating reliable, secure CI/CD workflows that provide rapid feedback for development teams. The CDK CLI integration is critical for infrastructure deployment automation. Ensure proper security practices for credential management and environment isolation.
