# Ticket 4.5.2: Data Collection Validation and API Integration Testing

### Estimate
3 hours

**Status**: Refinement Complete

#### Description
Validate data collection workflows and API integrations in the production environment to ensure all data collection processes operate successfully with real data processing. This ticket focuses on verifying scheduled job execution, event-driven processing, and API integration functionality with production credentials.

#### Technical Details
- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. Validate scheduled job execution (4 AM, 5 AM, 6 AM, 7 AM, hourly)
  2. Test event-driven processing (pollination workflows)
  3. Validate API integration functionality (Alpaca, AlphaVantage)
  4. Test data collection workflows with real data processing
  5. Validate scheduled job execution timing and reliability
  6. Test event-driven pollination workflows end-to-end
  7. Validate API integration with production credentials
  8. Test data processing and storage workflows
  9. Validate data quality and accuracy in production
  10. Implement data collection health check validation

- **Architecture Considerations**:
  - Scheduled job validation ensures proper execution timing and reliability
  - Event-driven processing validation confirms pollination workflows operational
  - API integration validation ensures production credentials functional
  - Data collection validation confirms real data processing successful

- API integration failures: Implement API retry logic, log API integration errors
- Data collection failures: Implement collection retry logic, log data collection errors
- Data quality failures: Implement quality validation fallback, log data quality errors

#### Monitoring and Observability
- **Metrics to track**:
  - Scheduled job execution success/failure rates
  - Event-driven processing success/failure rates
  - API integration success/failure rates
  - Data collection success/failure rates
  - Data quality validation success/failure rates
- **Logging requirements**:
  - Scheduled job execution logs and results
  - Event-driven processing logs and results
  - API integration logs and results
  - Data collection logs and results
  - Data quality validation logs and results
- **Alerting criteria**:
  - Scheduled job failure rate >15%
  - Event-driven processing failure rate >20%
  - API integration failure rate >25%
  - Data collection failure rate >20%
  - Data quality validation failure rate >15%

#### Open Questions
- None - all requirements clarified

#### Notes
Focus on validating data collection workflows and API integrations in the production environment. The scheduled job validation should ensure proper execution timing and reliability, while event-driven processing validation should confirm pollination workflows are operational. API integration validation should ensure production credentials are functional and data collection processes are successful with real data processing.
