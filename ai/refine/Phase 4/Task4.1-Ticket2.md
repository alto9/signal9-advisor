### Estimate
4 hours

**Status**: Refinement Complete

#### Description
Implement comprehensive unit tests for event-driven Lambda functions (TriggerEarningsPollenation, TriggerRegularPollenation, MarkEarningsProcessed) with focus on event processing, EventBridge integration, and complex business logic validation. This ticket focuses on testing event-driven workflows, event payload validation, and event dispatch logic.

#### Technical Details

  5. Implement EventBridge event dispatch testing with mocked EventBridge
  6. Create business logic testing for asset prioritization algorithms
  7. Implement DynamoDB query testing with mocked responses
  8. Create error scenario testing for event processing failures
  9. Implement event context testing (earnings vs. regular trigger differentiation)
  10. Create comprehensive edge case testing for event-driven workflows
