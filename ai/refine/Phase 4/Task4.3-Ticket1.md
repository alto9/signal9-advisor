# Ticket 4.3.1: CloudWatch Dashboard Creation and Configuration

### Estimate
4 hours

**Status**: Refinement Complete

#### Description
Create comprehensive CloudWatch dashboards for system monitoring and operational visibility. This ticket focuses on building detailed dashboards for system health, data quality, event processing, and API integration monitoring to provide operational teams with clear insights into system performance and health.

#### Technical Details
- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. Create system health dashboard with Lambda execution metrics, error rates, and duration
  2. Implement data quality dashboard with validation success rates, API call success, and processing volumes
  3. Create event processing dashboard with pollination metrics and event flow success
  4. Implement API integration dashboard with AlphaVantage rate limits and Alpaca API health
  5. Configure custom CloudWatch metrics for business-specific monitoring
  6. Set up dashboard refresh rates and data retention policies
  7. Implement dashboard access controls and permissions
  8. Create dashboard documentation and usage guidelines
  9. Set up dashboard testing and validation procedures
  10. Implement dashboard performance optimization and monitoring

- **Architecture Considerations**:
  - Comprehensive dashboards provide operational visibility across all system components
  - Custom metrics enable business-specific monitoring and alerting
  - Dashboard configuration supports real-time monitoring and historical analysis
  - Access controls ensure secure dashboard access for operational teams

- **Security Requirements**:
  - Dashboard access controls prevent unauthorized access to monitoring data
  - Custom metrics don't expose sensitive business or system information
  - Dashboard configuration follows security best practices
  - Data retention policies comply with security requirements

- **Performance Requirements**:
  - Dashboard loading and refresh performance optimized for operational use
  - Custom metrics collection efficient and doesn't impact system performance
  - Dashboard configuration supports real-time monitoring without performance degradation
  - Data retention policies balance operational needs with storage costs

#### Dependencies

  - Dashboard configuration testing with various metric combinations
  - Custom metrics implementation testing
  - Dashboard access control testing
  - Dashboard performance testing

- **Integration Tests**:
  - Dashboard integration testing with CloudWatch metrics
  - Custom metrics integration testing
  - Dashboard functionality integration testing
  - Dashboard access control integration testing

- **Performance Tests**:
  - Dashboard loading performance testing
  - Custom metrics collection performance testing
  - Dashboard refresh performance testing
  - Dashboard configuration performance testing

- **Security Tests**:
  - Dashboard access control security testing
  - Custom metrics security validation
  - Dashboard configuration security testing
