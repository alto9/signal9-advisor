# Ticket 1.2.2: Foundational Data Tables Implementation

### Estimate
4 hours

**Status**: Refinement Complete

#### Description
Implement the five foundational data DynamoDB tables (companyOverview, earnings, cashFlow, balanceSheet, incomeStatement) using AWS CDK. These tables follow the common pattern of symbol (PK) and fiscal_date_ending/last_updated (SK) for temporal queries. Each table requires specific GSIs for efficient data access patterns and financial analysis workflows.

#### Technical Details
- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. Extend `lib/constructs/database-construct.ts` with foundational data table constructs
  2. Implement `CompanyOverviewTable` construct with symbol (PK) and last_updated (SK)
  3. Configure sector-index GSI for companyOverview table
  4. Implement `EarningsTable` construct with symbol (PK) and fiscal_date_ending (SK)
  5. Implement `CashFlowTable` construct with symbol (PK) and fiscal_date_ending (SK)
  6. Implement `BalanceSheetTable` construct with symbol (PK) and fiscal_date_ending (SK)
  7. Implement `IncomeStatementTable` construct with symbol (PK) and fiscal_date_ending (SK)
  8. Configure appropriate GSIs for each foundational data table
  9. Set up on-demand billing for all foundational data tables
  10. Configure backup and point-in-time recovery settings
  11. Implement consistent resource tagging across all foundational tables

- **Architecture Considerations**:
  - Follow the established pattern of symbol (PK) and temporal (SK) for all foundational tables
  - Implement appropriate GSIs for sector-based and temporal queries
  - Use modular constructs that can be easily maintained and updated
  - Ensure consistent naming and tagging patterns across all foundational tables
  - Optimize for financial data analysis workflows

- **Security Requirements**:
  - Enable encryption at rest for all foundational data tables
  - Configure proper IAM policies for table access
  - Implement secure resource tagging patterns
  - Follow AWS security best practices for financial data storage

- **Performance Requirements**:
  - Table creation time < 8 minutes for all foundational tables
  - GSI creation time < 3 minutes per table
  - Proper indexing for financial data query optimization

#### Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**:
  - Ticket 1.2.1: Core DynamoDB Tables Implementation
- **Dependent Tickets**:
  - Task 1.3: Lambda Function Infrastructure Framework
  - Phase 2: Data Collection Implementation

#### Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**:
  - CDK synthesis validation for foundational table configurations
  - GSI configuration validation tests for each table
  - Resource naming pattern validation
  - Tagging compliance validation
  - Encryption configuration validation
  - Temporal key pattern validation

- **Integration Tests**:
  - Foundational table creation validation in development environment
  - GSI creation and configuration validation
  - Backup and point-in-time recovery validation
  - Environment-based naming validation
  - Cross-table relationship validation

- **Performance Tests**:
  - Foundational table creation performance validation
  - GSI creation performance validation
  - Temporal query pattern validation

- **Security Tests**:
  - Encryption configuration validation for financial data
  - IAM policy validation for table access
  - Resource tagging security validation
  - Financial data security compliance validation

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] CompanyOverview table created with symbol/last_updated keys and sector-index GSI
- [ ] Earnings table created with symbol/fiscal_date_ending keys
- [ ] CashFlow table created with symbol/fiscal_date_ending keys
- [ ] BalanceSheet table created with symbol/fiscal_date_ending keys
- [ ] IncomeStatement table created with symbol/fiscal_date_ending keys
- [ ] All GSIs properly configured for financial data queries
- [ ] On-demand billing enabled for all foundational tables
- [ ] Backup and point-in-time recovery configured
- [ ] Encryption at rest enabled for all foundational tables
- [ ] Proper resource tagging implemented for financial data
- [ ] Environment-based naming conventions applied
- [ ] Temporal key patterns consistent across all tables
- [ ] CDK synthesis completes successfully without errors
- [ ] All foundational tables deploy successfully in development environment
- [ ] All unit tests pass with >90% coverage
- [ ] Table creation time < 8 minutes for all foundational tables
- [ ] GSI creation time < 3 minutes per table

#### Error Handling
- DynamoDB table creation error handling and rollback for financial data
- GSI creation error handling and recovery
- Resource naming conflict detection and resolution
- CDK synthesis error handling and validation
- Financial data table relationship validation

#### Monitoring and Observability
- Foundational table creation performance metrics
- GSI creation performance metrics
- Financial data table configuration validation logging
- Temporal key pattern validation logging
- Cross-table relationship validation logging

#### Open Questions
- None - all requirements are clear from the existing documentation and models

#### Notes
Focus on creating robust, maintainable DynamoDB table constructs for financial data that follow AWS CDK best practices. The foundational data tables are critical for the financial analysis system, so ensure proper indexing for temporal queries and sector-based analysis. The implementation should support the data collection workflows that will populate these tables with financial data from AlphaVantage API. Pay special attention to the temporal key patterns and ensure they support efficient historical data queries.
