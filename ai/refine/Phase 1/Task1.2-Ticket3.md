# Ticket 1.2.3: DynamoDB Table Validation and Documentation

### Estimate
2 hours

**Status**: Refinement Complete

#### Description
Implement comprehensive validation, testing, and documentation for all DynamoDB tables created in the Signal9 data collection system. This includes creating CDK infrastructure tests, validating table configurations, documenting table schemas and access patterns, and ensuring all tables meet the operational requirements for the financial data collection system.

#### Technical Details
- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. Create comprehensive CDK infrastructure tests for all DynamoDB tables
  2. Implement table configuration validation tests
  3. Create GSI configuration validation tests
  4. Implement access pattern testing with sample queries
  5. Create table schema documentation with examples
  6. Document table relationships and data flow patterns
  7. Implement table performance validation tests
  8. Create operational runbooks for table management
  9. Validate backup and point-in-time recovery configurations
  10. Create table monitoring and alerting documentation

- **Architecture Considerations**:
  - Ensure all tables support the intended access patterns
  - Validate GSI configurations for query optimization
  - Document table relationships for data integrity
  - Create comprehensive testing coverage for all table configurations
  - Establish monitoring and alerting patterns for table health

- **Security Requirements**:
  - Validate encryption configurations for all tables
  - Test IAM policy configurations for table access
  - Document security best practices for table management
  - Validate resource tagging compliance

- **Performance Requirements**:
  - Validate table creation performance meets requirements
  - Test GSI creation and query performance
  - Document performance benchmarks and optimization strategies
  - Validate on-demand billing configurations

#### Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**:
  - Ticket 1.2.1: Core DynamoDB Tables Implementation
  - Ticket 1.2.2: Foundational Data Tables Implementation
- **Dependent Tickets**:
  - Task 1.3: Lambda Function Infrastructure Framework
  - Task 1.7: Infrastructure Documentation and Validation

#### Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**:
  - CDK infrastructure tests for all table configurations
  - GSI configuration validation tests
  - Resource naming pattern validation tests
  - Tagging compliance validation tests
  - Encryption configuration validation tests
  - Access pattern validation tests

- **Integration Tests**:
  - End-to-end table creation validation
  - Cross-table relationship validation
  - Backup and recovery validation
  - Environment-based configuration validation
  - Performance benchmark validation

- **Performance Tests**:
  - Table creation performance validation
  - GSI creation performance validation
  - Query pattern performance validation
  - On-demand billing validation

- **Security Tests**:
  - Encryption configuration validation
  - IAM policy validation for table access
  - Resource tagging security validation
  - Access pattern security validation

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Comprehensive CDK infrastructure tests created for all tables
- [ ] All table configurations validated and tested
- [ ] GSI configurations validated for query optimization
- [ ] Access patterns tested with sample queries
- [ ] Table schema documentation completed with examples
- [ ] Table relationships and data flow documented
- [ ] Performance validation tests implemented
- [ ] Operational runbooks created for table management
- [ ] Backup and point-in-time recovery configurations validated
- [ ] Table monitoring and alerting documentation completed
- [ ] All unit tests pass with >95% coverage
- [ ] All integration tests pass successfully

- [ ] Security configurations validated
- [ ] Documentation reviewed and approved

#### Error Handling
- Table configuration validation error handling
- GSI configuration error handling and recovery
- Performance test failure handling and reporting
- Documentation validation error handling
- Cross-table relationship validation error handling

#### Monitoring and Observability
- Table creation performance metrics
- GSI creation performance metrics
- Query pattern performance metrics
- Table configuration validation logging
- Documentation completeness metrics

#### Open Questions
- None - all requirements are clear from the existing documentation and models

#### Notes
This ticket serves as the final validation and documentation phase for all DynamoDB tables. Focus on creating comprehensive tests and documentation that will support the operational requirements of the financial data collection system. Ensure all tables are properly validated for their intended use cases and that the documentation provides clear guidance for future development and operations teams. The validation should confirm that all tables support the specific access patterns identified in the system design and that the performance characteristics meet the operational requirements.
