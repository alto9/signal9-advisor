# Ticket 1.5.1: Secrets Manager Infrastructure and Secret Creation

### Estimate
2 hours

**Status**: Refinement Complete

#### Description
Create the AWS Secrets Manager infrastructure and implement secret creation for AlphaVantage and Alpaca API credentials. This includes creating CDK constructs for Secrets Manager, implementing secret creation with proper naming conventions, and setting up placeholder credentials for development and testing environments.

#### Technical Details
- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. Create `lib/constructs/secrets-manager-construct.ts` for Secrets Manager constructs
  2. Implement `SecretsManagerConstruct` base construct with common configuration patterns
  3. Create secret entries for both API integrations:
     - **AlphaVantageCredentials**: API key for AlphaVantage integration
     - **AlpacaCredentials**: API key and secret for Alpaca integration
  4. Configure environment-based secret naming (dev/staging/prod)
  5. Set up placeholder credentials for development and testing:
     - AlphaVantage: Placeholder API key for development
     - Alpaca: Placeholder API key and secret for development
  6. Configure secret descriptions and tags for proper identification
  7. Implement secret versioning and rotation policies (manual rotation)
  8. Set up proper resource tagging and monitoring

- **Architecture Considerations**:
  - Follow AWS CDK best practices for Secrets Manager creation
  - Implement environment-based secret naming (dev/staging/prod)
  - Use modular constructs for maintainable infrastructure code
  - Ensure proper secret structure for each API integration
  - Establish foundation for secure credential management

- **Security Requirements**:
  - Implement secure resource tagging patterns
  - Follow AWS security best practices for Secrets Manager configuration
  - Ensure no sensitive information in CDK code or logs
  - Configure proper secret access controls
  - Implement placeholder credentials for development

- **Performance Requirements**:
  - Secret creation time < 2 minutes per secret
  - CDK synthesis time < 1 minute for all secrets
  - Proper resource organization for efficient deployment

#### Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**:
  - Task 1.3: Lambda Function Infrastructure Framework (all tickets)
- **Dependent Tickets**:
  - Ticket 1.5.2: IAM Policies and Access Configuration
  - Task 1.6: CloudWatch Monitoring Setup

#### Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**:
  - Secrets Manager creation validation tests
  - Secret structure validation tests
  - Resource naming pattern validation
  - Tagging compliance validation
  - Environment-based naming validation

- **Integration Tests**:
  - Secrets Manager creation validation in development environment
  - Placeholder credential validation
  - Secret versioning validation
  - Environment-based naming validation

- **Performance Tests**:
  - Secret creation performance validation
  - CDK synthesis performance validation

- **Security Tests**:
  - Resource naming security validation
  - Secret access control validation
  - Placeholder credential security validation

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `lib/constructs/secrets-manager-construct.ts` created with Secrets Manager constructs
- [ ] AlphaVantageCredentials secret created with API key structure
- [ ] AlpacaCredentials secret created with API key and secret structure
- [ ] Environment-based secret naming conventions applied
- [ ] Placeholder credentials configured for development environment
- [ ] Secret descriptions and tags properly configured
- [ ] Secret versioning and rotation policies configured (manual)
- [ ] Proper resource tagging implemented
- [ ] CDK synthesis completes successfully without errors
- [ ] All secrets deploy successfully in development environment
- [ ] Placeholder credentials accessible for testing
- [ ] All unit tests pass with >90% coverage
- [ ] Secret creation time < 2 minutes per secret
- [ ] CDK synthesis time < 1 minute for all secrets

#### Error Handling
- Secrets Manager creation error handling and rollback
- Secret structure validation error handling
- Placeholder credential configuration error handling
- CDK synthesis error handling and validation

#### Monitoring and Observability
- Secrets Manager creation performance metrics
- Secret structure validation logging
- Placeholder credential configuration logging
- Environment-based naming validation logging

#### Open Questions
- None - all requirements are clear from the existing documentation

#### Notes
Focus on creating robust, maintainable Secrets Manager constructs that follow AWS CDK best practices. The secret structures should match the expected format for each API integration. Ensure placeholder credentials are properly configured for development and testing without exposing sensitive information. The implementation should support the secure credential management approach and prepare for the IAM policies and access configuration in the next ticket.
