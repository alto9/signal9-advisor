# Ticket 1.1.2: Environment Configuration Setup

### Estimate
2 hours

**Status**: Refinement Complete

#### Description
Configure deployment environments (development, staging, production) with proper AWS credentials, deployment profiles, and environment-specific configurations. This includes setting up AWS profiles, configuring CDK context for environment management, and establishing deployment procedures for each environment.

#### Technical Details
- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. Configure AWS CLI profiles for development, staging, and production environments
  2. Set up CDK context configuration for environment-specific settings
  3. Create environment-specific resource naming conventions
  4. Configure AWS credentials and access patterns for each environment
  5. Set up deployment profiles and permissions validation
  6. Create environment-specific configuration documentation

- **Architecture Considerations**:
  - Implement environment isolation for secure deployments
  - Use consistent naming patterns across environments
  - Ensure proper AWS account/region configuration per environment
  - Follow least privilege principle for environment access

- **Security Requirements**:
  - Separate AWS credentials for each environment
  - Environment-specific IAM roles and permissions
  - Secure credential management and rotation procedures
  - No cross-environment credential sharing

- **Performance Requirements**:
  - Environment switching time < 30 seconds
  - Deployment profile validation < 10 seconds

#### Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**:
  - Ticket 1.1.1: CDK Project Structure Initialization
  - AWS account access for all environments
  - AWS CLI properly configured
- **Dependent Tickets**:
  - Ticket 1.1.3: CDK Application Entry Point Implementation

#### Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**:
  - Environment context validation tests
  - AWS credential validation tests
  - Resource naming pattern tests
  - CDK context configuration tests

- **Integration Tests**:
  - Environment switching validation
  - AWS profile access testing
  - Deployment profile validation

- **Performance Tests**:
  - Environment configuration loading performance
  - AWS credential validation performance

- **Security Tests**:
  - Environment isolation validation
  - Credential access validation
  - Permission boundary testing

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] AWS CLI profiles configured for dev/staging/prod environments
- [ ] CDK context properly configured for environment management
- [ ] Environment-specific resource naming conventions established
- [ ] AWS credentials properly configured for each environment
- [ ] Deployment profiles validated and documented
- [ ] Environment switching procedures documented
- [ ] All environment configuration tests pass
- [ ] Environment isolation validated
- [ ] Credential management procedures documented
- [ ] Environment-specific configuration documentation completed

#### Error Handling
- AWS credential validation error handling
- Environment context validation error reporting
- Deployment profile access error handling
- Environment switching error recovery procedures

#### Monitoring and Observability
- Environment configuration validation logging
- AWS credential access logging
- Deployment profile usage metrics
- Environment switching performance metrics

#### Open Questions
- None - all requirements are clear from the existing documentation

#### Notes
Focus on creating a secure and maintainable environment configuration that supports the development workflow. Ensure proper isolation between environments and follow AWS security best practices for credential management. The configuration should support the tag-based production deployments mentioned in the operational context.
