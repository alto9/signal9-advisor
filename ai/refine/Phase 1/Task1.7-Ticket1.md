# Ticket 1.7.1: Infrastructure Documentation and Deployment Procedures

### Estimate
2 hours

**Status**: Refinement Complete

#### Description
Create comprehensive documentation for the infrastructure setup and deployment procedures. This includes documenting the complete infrastructure architecture, deployment procedures for all environments, operational runbooks for common tasks, and establishing deployment and rollback procedures documentation.

#### Technical Details
- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. Create `docs/infrastructure/` directory structure for documentation
  2. Update `README.md` with comprehensive infrastructure documentation:
     - Complete architecture overview with all Phase 1 components
     - Detailed deployment procedures for dev/staging/prod environments
     - Environment configuration and AWS profile setup
     - CDK bootstrap and deployment commands
     - Resource naming conventions and tagging strategies
  3. Create `docs/infrastructure/deployment.md` with detailed deployment procedures:
     - First-time setup procedures
     - Environment-specific deployment commands
     - CDK diff and validation procedures
     - Resource creation and update procedures
     - Deployment troubleshooting and common issues
  4. Create `docs/infrastructure/operational-runbooks.md` with operational procedures:
     - DynamoDB table management and monitoring
     - Lambda function deployment and configuration
     - EventBridge rule management and monitoring
     - Secrets Manager secret rotation procedures
     - CloudWatch log group and dashboard management
     - Infrastructure scaling and performance tuning
  5. Create `docs/infrastructure/rollback-procedures.md` with rollback documentation:
     - CDK rollback procedures using previous versions
     - Git tag-based rollback procedures
     - Resource-specific rollback strategies
     - Emergency rollback procedures
     - Rollback validation and testing procedures
  6. Create `docs/infrastructure/cost-estimation.md` with cost documentation:
     - Monthly cost estimates for all AWS resources
     - Cost optimization strategies and recommendations
     - Resource sizing guidelines and recommendations
     - Cost monitoring and alerting setup
     - Budget tracking and management procedures
  7. Create `docs/infrastructure/security-review.md` with security documentation:
     - IAM policy review and compliance validation
     - Security best practices implementation
     - Encryption configuration validation
     - Access control and permission validation
     - Security monitoring and alerting setup
  8. Update project structure documentation with all new components

- **Architecture Considerations**:
  - Follow documentation best practices with clear structure and navigation
  - Implement environment-specific documentation sections
  - Use consistent formatting and naming conventions
  - Ensure documentation is maintainable and version-controlled
  - Include practical examples and troubleshooting guides

- **Security Requirements**:
  - Document security best practices and compliance requirements
  - Include IAM policy review procedures and validation
  - Document encryption configuration and validation
  - Include access control and permission validation procedures
  - Document security monitoring and alerting requirements

- **Performance Requirements**:
  - Documentation creation time < 30 minutes
  - Documentation review and validation time < 15 minutes
  - Clear and concise procedures for quick reference
  - Searchable and well-organized documentation structure

#### Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**:
  - All previous Phase 1 tasks (1.1-1.6) completed
- **Dependent Tickets**:
  - Ticket 1.7.2: Infrastructure Validation and Testing
  - Phase 2: Data Collection Implementation

#### Testing Requirements
- **Documentation Tests**:
  - Documentation completeness validation tests
  - Procedure accuracy validation tests
  - Link and reference validation tests
  - Formatting and structure validation tests
  - Content review and validation tests

- **Deployment Tests**:
  - Deployment procedure validation in development environment
  - Environment configuration validation
  - CDK command validation
  - Resource creation validation
  - Rollback procedure validation

- **Operational Tests**:
  - Operational runbook procedure validation
  - Common task procedure validation
  - Troubleshooting guide validation
  - Cost estimation validation

- **Security Tests**:
  - Security review procedure validation
  - IAM policy validation
  - Encryption configuration validation
  - Access control validation

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `docs/infrastructure/` directory structure created
- [ ] `README.md` updated with comprehensive infrastructure documentation
- [ ] `docs/infrastructure/deployment.md` created with detailed deployment procedures
- [ ] `docs/infrastructure/operational-runbooks.md` created with operational procedures
- [ ] `docs/infrastructure/rollback-procedures.md` created with rollback documentation
- [ ] `docs/infrastructure/cost-estimation.md` created with cost documentation
- [ ] `docs/infrastructure/security-review.md` created with security documentation
- [ ] All documentation follows consistent formatting and structure
- [ ] All deployment procedures validated in development environment
- [ ] All operational runbooks tested and validated
- [ ] All rollback procedures tested and validated
- [ ] Cost estimation documentation validated and accurate
- [ ] Security review documentation completed and validated
- [ ] All documentation links and references working correctly
- [ ] Documentation creation time < 30 minutes
- [ ] Documentation review and validation time < 15 minutes

#### Error Handling
- Documentation creation error handling and validation
- Deployment procedure error handling and troubleshooting
- Operational runbook error handling and validation
- Rollback procedure error handling and validation

#### Monitoring and Observability
- Documentation creation performance metrics
- Deployment procedure validation logging
- Operational runbook validation logging
- Security review validation logging

#### Open Questions
- None - all requirements are clear from the existing documentation

#### Notes
Focus on creating comprehensive, maintainable documentation that follows best practices and provides clear guidance for all infrastructure operations. The documentation should be practical, well-organized, and include troubleshooting guides for common issues. Ensure all procedures are tested and validated in the development environment before finalizing the documentation. The documentation should serve as the foundation for operational procedures and prepare for the infrastructure validation and testing in the next ticket.
