# Ticket 1.1.1: CDK Project Structure Initialization

### Estimate
4 hours

**Status**: Refinement Complete

#### Description
Initialize the AWS CDK project structure with TypeScript, create the basic directory structure, and set up the foundational CDK application architecture. This includes creating the main CDK app entry point, establishing the stack organization, and configuring the development environment.

#### Technical Details
- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. Create the `bin/` directory and main CDK app entry point (`bin/signal9-advisor.ts`)
  2. Create the `lib/` directory and main stack file (`lib/signal9-advisor-stack.ts`)
  3. Create the `lib/constructs/` directory for modular infrastructure components
  4. Set up TypeScript configuration for CDK development
  5. Configure CDK app with proper environment context handling
  6. Create basic stack structure with environment-based resource naming

- **Architecture Considerations**:
  - Follow AWS CDK best practices for project organization
  - Implement environment-based resource naming (dev/staging/prod)
  - Use modular constructs for maintainable infrastructure code
  - Ensure proper TypeScript configuration for CDK development

- **Security Requirements**:
  - Implement proper resource tagging for cost tracking and security
  - Follow AWS security best practices for resource naming
  - Ensure no hardcoded credentials in infrastructure code

- **Performance Requirements**:
  - CDK synthesis time < 30 seconds
  - Proper resource organization for efficient deployment

#### Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**:
  - AWS account access and permissions
  - Node.js v18+ and npm installed
  - AWS CDK CLI installed globally
- **Dependent Tickets**:
  - Ticket 1.1.2: Environment Configuration Setup
  - Ticket 1.1.3: CDK Application Entry Point Implementation

#### Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**:
  - CDK synthesis validation tests
  - Stack structure validation tests
  - Environment context handling tests
  - Resource naming pattern validation

- **Integration Tests**:
  - CDK diff validation for infrastructure changes
  - Basic deployment testing in development environment

- **Performance Tests**:
  - CDK synthesis performance validation

- **Security Tests**:
  - Resource naming security validation
  - Tagging compliance validation

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `bin/signal9-advisor.ts` created with proper CDK app structure
- [ ] `lib/signal9-advisor-stack.ts` created with basic stack definition
- [ ] `lib/constructs/` directory created for modular components
- [ ] TypeScript configuration properly set up for CDK development
- [ ] Environment-based resource naming implemented
- [ ] CDK synthesis completes successfully without errors
- [ ] Basic stack structure validates with CDK diff
- [ ] Resource tagging implemented for cost tracking
- [ ] All unit tests pass with >90% coverage
- [ ] CDK synthesis time < 30 seconds

#### Error Handling
- CDK synthesis error handling and validation
- Environment context validation and error reporting
- Resource naming conflict detection and resolution
- TypeScript compilation error handling

#### Monitoring and Observability
- CDK synthesis performance metrics
- Resource creation validation logging
- Environment context validation logging

#### Open Questions
- None - all requirements are clear from the existing documentation

#### Notes
Focus on creating a clean, maintainable CDK project structure that follows AWS best practices. The existing `cdk.json` and `package.json` files provide good foundation, but the actual CDK application structure needs to be created. Ensure the structure supports the modular approach needed for the 7 Lambda functions and 4 DynamoDB tables planned for the system.
