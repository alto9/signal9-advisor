# Ticket 1.6.2: CloudWatch Metrics and Dashboard Implementation

### Estimate
2 hours

**Status**: Refinement Complete

#### Description
Implement basic CloudWatch metrics collection and create an initial dashboard for system health monitoring. This includes setting up basic metrics for Lambda execution and errors, creating a CloudWatch dashboard for infrastructure visibility, and establishing the foundation for operational observability.

#### Technical Details
- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. Extend `lib/constructs/cloudwatch-construct.ts` with metrics and dashboard constructs
  2. Implement `CloudWatchMetrics` construct for basic metrics collection
  3. Create basic metrics for Lambda function monitoring:
     - **Lambda Execution Metrics**: Duration, errors, throttles, invocations
     - **Lambda Error Metrics**: Error count, error rate, timeout count
     - **Lambda Performance Metrics**: Memory utilization, concurrent executions
  4. Implement `CloudWatchDashboard` construct for system overview
  5. Create initial CloudWatch dashboard with basic widgets:
     - **Lambda Function Overview**: Execution metrics for all 7 functions
     - **Error Rate Monitoring**: Error rates and failure counts
     - **Performance Metrics**: Duration and memory utilization
     - **System Health Summary**: Overall system status
  6. Configure dashboard refresh intervals and time ranges
  7. Set up environment-based dashboard naming (dev/staging/prod)
  8. Implement proper resource tagging and monitoring

- **Architecture Considerations**:
  - Follow AWS CDK best practices for CloudWatch metrics and dashboard creation
  - Implement environment-based dashboard naming (dev/staging/prod)
  - Use modular constructs for maintainable infrastructure code
  - Ensure consistent metrics collection across all functions
  - Establish foundation for advanced monitoring in later phases

- **Security Requirements**:
  - Implement secure resource tagging patterns
  - Follow AWS security best practices for CloudWatch configuration
  - Ensure proper IAM permissions for metrics and dashboard access
  - Configure dashboard access controls

- **Performance Requirements**:
  - Dashboard creation time < 2 minutes
  - Metrics collection setup time < 1 minute
  - CDK synthesis time < 2 minutes for all monitoring components
  - Proper resource organization for efficient deployment

#### Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**:
  - Ticket 1.6.1: CloudWatch Log Groups and Structured Logging Foundation
- **Dependent Tickets**:
  - Task 1.7: Infrastructure Documentation and Validation
  - Phase 2: Data Collection Implementation

#### Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**:
  - CloudWatch metrics creation validation tests
  - Dashboard creation validation tests
  - Resource naming pattern validation
  - Tagging compliance validation
  - Environment-based naming validation

- **Integration Tests**:
  - CloudWatch metrics creation validation in development environment
  - Dashboard functionality validation
  - Metrics collection testing
  - Environment-based naming validation
  - Dashboard widget configuration validation

- **Performance Tests**:
  - Dashboard creation performance validation
  - Metrics collection performance validation
  - CDK synthesis performance validation

- **Security Tests**:
  - Resource naming security validation
  - IAM permission validation for metrics and dashboard access
  - Dashboard access control validation

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] CloudWatch metrics collection configured for all Lambda functions
- [ ] Basic Lambda execution metrics operational (duration, errors, throttles, invocations)
- [ ] Basic Lambda error metrics operational (error count, error rate, timeout count)
- [ ] Basic Lambda performance metrics operational (memory utilization, concurrent executions)
- [ ] Initial CloudWatch dashboard created with system overview widgets
- [ ] Dashboard includes Lambda function overview, error rate monitoring, and performance metrics
- [ ] Dashboard refresh intervals and time ranges configured appropriately
- [ ] Environment-based dashboard naming conventions applied
- [ ] Proper resource tagging implemented
- [ ] CDK synthesis completes successfully without errors
- [ ] All monitoring components deploy successfully in development environment
- [ ] Dashboard provides system health visibility
- [ ] Metrics collection working correctly
- [ ] All unit tests pass with >90% coverage
- [ ] Dashboard creation time < 2 minutes
- [ ] Metrics collection setup time < 1 minute
- [ ] CDK synthesis time < 2 minutes for all monitoring components

#### Error Handling
- CloudWatch metrics creation error handling and rollback
- Dashboard creation error handling
- Metrics collection configuration error handling
- CDK synthesis error handling and validation

#### Monitoring and Observability
- CloudWatch metrics creation performance metrics
- Dashboard creation performance metrics
- Metrics collection validation logging
- Dashboard functionality validation logging

#### Open Questions
- None - all requirements are clear from the existing documentation

#### Notes
Focus on creating robust, maintainable CloudWatch monitoring constructs that follow AWS CDK best practices. The metrics and dashboard should provide basic system health visibility as specified in the TRD document. Ensure the dashboard is designed to be easily enhanced in later phases with more advanced metrics and alerting. The implementation should support the operational observability requirements and prepare for the infrastructure documentation and validation in the final task.
