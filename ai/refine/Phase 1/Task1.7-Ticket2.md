# Ticket 1.7.2: Infrastructure Validation and Testing

### Estimate
2 hours

**Status**: Refinement Complete

#### Description
Perform comprehensive validation and testing of all Phase 1 infrastructure components. This includes end-to-end infrastructure deployment testing, resource connectivity validation, deployment procedure validation, and ensuring the system is ready for Phase 2 development.

     - EventBridge rule creation and configuration validation
     - Secrets Manager secret creation and configuration validation
     - CloudWatch log groups and dashboard validation
  4. Implement `test/infrastructure/connectivity-validation.test.ts` for connectivity testing:
     - Lambda function to DynamoDB connectivity validation
     - Lambda function to Secrets Manager connectivity validation
     - EventBridge to Lambda function connectivity validation
     - CloudWatch logging connectivity validation
     - Cross-resource permission validation

     - CDK deployment procedure validation
     - Environment configuration validation
     - Resource naming convention validation
     - Resource tagging validation
     - Deployment rollback validation
  6. Create `scripts/validate-infrastructure.sh` for automated validation:
     - Automated infrastructure validation script
     - Resource health check procedures
     - Connectivity test procedures
     - Performance baseline validation
     - Security configuration validation
  7. Implement `test/infrastructure/performance-validation.test.ts` for performance testing:
     - Resource creation performance validation
     - CDK synthesis performance validation
     - Deployment time validation
     - Resource scaling validation
     - Cost baseline validation
  8. Create validation reports and documentation:
     - Infrastructure validation report template
     - Resource health status reporting
     - Performance baseline documentation
     - Security validation report
     - Deployment readiness assessment

- **Architecture Considerations**:
  - Follow AWS CDK testing best practices for infrastructure validation
  - Implement comprehensive resource validation across all components
  - Use modular test structure for maintainable validation procedures
  - Ensure validation covers all Phase 1 infrastructure components
  - Establish baseline metrics for performance and cost validation

- **Security Requirements**:
  - Implement security validation for all infrastructure components
  - Validate IAM policies and permissions

- None - all requirements are clear from the existing documentation

#### Notes
Focus on creating comprehensive, automated validation procedures that thoroughly test all Phase 1 infrastructure components. The validation should ensure that all resources are properly created, configured, and connected according to the specifications. Establish performance baselines and security validation procedures that can be used for ongoing monitoring and comparison. The validation should provide confidence that the infrastructure is ready for Phase 2 development and can support the data collection implementation requirements.
