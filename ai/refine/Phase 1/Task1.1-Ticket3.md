# Ticket 1.1.3: CDK Application Entry Point Implementation

### Estimate
2 hours

**Status**: Refinement Complete

#### Description
Implement the main CDK application entry point with proper stack instantiation, environment handling, and basic stack organization. This includes creating the main CDK app file, implementing the basic stack structure, and establishing the foundation for modular infrastructure management.

#### Technical Details
- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. Implement `bin/signal9-advisor.ts` with proper CDK app structure
  2. Create main stack class in `lib/signal9-advisor-stack.ts`
  3. Implement environment-based stack instantiation
  4. Set up basic resource tagging and naming conventions
  5. Configure stack properties and metadata
  6. Implement basic stack organization for modular components
  7. Add stack outputs for resource references

- **Architecture Considerations**:
  - Follow AWS CDK best practices for stack organization
  - Implement proper resource tagging for cost tracking
  - Use environment-based resource naming patterns
  - Establish foundation for modular construct integration
  - Ensure proper stack dependency management

- **Security Requirements**:
  - Implement secure resource tagging patterns
  - Follow AWS security best practices for stack configuration
  - Ensure no sensitive information in stack outputs
  - Implement proper IAM role and policy structure

- **Performance Requirements**:
  - CDK app initialization time < 5 seconds
  - Stack synthesis time < 30 seconds
  - Proper resource organization for efficient deployment

#### Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**:
  - Ticket 1.1.1: CDK Project Structure Initialization
  - Ticket 1.1.2: Environment Configuration Setup
- **Dependent Tickets**:
  - Task 1.2: DynamoDB Tables Infrastructure
  - Task 1.3: Lambda Function Infrastructure Framework

#### Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**:
  - CDK app initialization tests
  - Stack instantiation tests
  - Environment context handling tests
  - Resource tagging validation tests
  - Stack outputs validation tests

- **Integration Tests**:
  - CDK synthesis validation
  - Stack deployment testing in development environment
  - Environment switching validation
  - Resource creation validation

- **Performance Tests**:
  - CDK app initialization performance
  - Stack synthesis performance validation

- **Security Tests**:
  - Resource tagging security validation
  - Stack outputs security validation
  - IAM role and policy validation

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `bin/signal9-advisor.ts` implements proper CDK app structure
- [ ] `lib/signal9-advisor-stack.ts` implements main stack class
- [ ] Environment-based stack instantiation working correctly
- [ ] Resource tagging implemented for cost tracking
- [ ] Stack outputs properly configured for resource references
- [ ] CDK synthesis completes successfully without errors
- [ ] Basic stack deploys successfully in development environment
- [ ] Environment switching works correctly
- [ ] All unit tests pass with >90% coverage
- [ ] CDK app initialization time < 5 seconds
- [ ] Stack synthesis time < 30 seconds
- [ ] Resource tagging follows security best practices

#### Error Handling
- CDK app initialization error handling
- Stack instantiation error handling
- Environment context validation error reporting
- Resource creation error handling and rollback procedures

#### Monitoring and Observability
- CDK app initialization logging
- Stack synthesis performance metrics
- Resource creation validation logging
- Environment switching performance metrics

#### Open Questions
- None - all requirements are clear from the existing documentation

#### Notes
This ticket establishes the foundational CDK application structure that will support all subsequent infrastructure development. Focus on creating a clean, maintainable structure that follows AWS CDK best practices and supports the modular approach needed for the 7 Lambda functions and 4 DynamoDB tables. The implementation should be ready for the next phase of infrastructure development.
