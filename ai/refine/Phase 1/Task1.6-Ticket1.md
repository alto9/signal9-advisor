# Ticket 1.6.1: CloudWatch Log Groups and Structured Logging Foundation

### Estimate
2 hours

**Status**: Refinement Complete

#### Description
Create CloudWatch log groups for all 7 Lambda functions and establish the structured logging foundation for the Signal9 data collection system. This includes setting up log groups with proper retention policies, implementing structured logging patterns with correlation IDs, and configuring logging permissions for all Lambda functions.

#### Technical Details
- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. Create `lib/constructs/cloudwatch-construct.ts` for CloudWatch constructs
  2. Implement `CloudWatchLogGroup` base construct with common configuration patterns
  3. Create log groups for all 7 Lambda functions:
     - **SyncAssets**: `/aws/lambda/signal9-sync-assets`
     - **SyncEarningsCalendar**: `/aws/lambda/signal9-sync-earnings-calendar`
     - **TriggerEarningsPollenation**: `/aws/lambda/signal9-trigger-earnings-pollenation`
     - **TriggerRegularPollenation**: `/aws/lambda/signal9-trigger-regular-pollenation`
     - **SyncNewsSentiment**: `/aws/lambda/signal9-sync-news-sentiment`
     - **PollenateAsset**: `/aws/lambda/signal9-pollenate-asset`
     - **MarkEarningsProcessed**: `/aws/lambda/signal9-mark-earnings-processed`
  4. Configure log retention policies (30 days for application logs)
  5. Set up structured logging patterns with correlation IDs
  6. Configure log levels (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG)
  7. Implement environment-based log group naming (dev/staging/prod)
  8. Set up proper resource tagging and monitoring

- **Architecture Considerations**:
  - Follow AWS CDK best practices for CloudWatch log group creation
  - Implement environment-based log group naming (dev/staging/prod)
  - Use modular constructs for maintainable infrastructure code
  - Ensure consistent logging patterns across all functions
  - Establish foundation for operational observability

- **Security Requirements**:
  - Implement secure resource tagging patterns
  - Follow AWS security best practices for CloudWatch configuration
  - Ensure proper IAM permissions for Lambda function logging
  - Configure log group access controls

- **Performance Requirements**:
  - Log group creation time < 1 minute per log group
  - CDK synthesis time < 2 minutes for all log groups
  - Proper resource organization for efficient deployment

#### Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**:
  - Task 1.3: Lambda Function Infrastructure Framework (all tickets)
- **Dependent Tickets**:
  - Ticket 1.6.2: CloudWatch Metrics and Dashboard Implementation
  - Task 1.7: Infrastructure Documentation and Validation

#### Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**:
  - CloudWatch log group creation validation tests
  - Log retention policy validation tests
  - Resource naming pattern validation
  - Tagging compliance validation
  - Environment-based naming validation

- **Integration Tests**:
  - CloudWatch log group creation validation in development environment
  - Lambda function logging validation
  - Log retention policy testing
  - Environment-based naming validation

- **Performance Tests**:
  - Log group creation performance validation
  - CDK synthesis performance validation

- **Security Tests**:
  - Resource naming security validation
  - IAM permission validation for logging
  - Log group access control validation

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `lib/constructs/cloudwatch-construct.ts` created with CloudWatch constructs
- [ ] All 7 Lambda function log groups created with proper naming
- [ ] Log retention policies configured (30 days for application logs)
- [ ] Structured logging patterns established with correlation IDs
- [ ] Log levels configured (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG)
- [ ] Environment-based log group naming conventions applied
- [ ] Proper resource tagging implemented
- [ ] CDK synthesis completes successfully without errors
- [ ] All log groups deploy successfully in development environment
- [ ] Lambda functions can successfully write to log groups
- [ ] Log retention policies working correctly
- [ ] All unit tests pass with >90% coverage
- [ ] Log group creation time < 1 minute per log group
- [ ] CDK synthesis time < 2 minutes for all log groups

#### Error Handling
- CloudWatch log group creation error handling and rollback
- Log retention policy configuration error handling
- Lambda function logging error handling
- CDK synthesis error handling and validation

#### Monitoring and Observability
- CloudWatch log group creation performance metrics
- Log retention policy configuration logging
- Lambda function logging validation logging
- Environment-based naming validation logging

#### Open Questions
- None - all requirements are clear from the existing documentation

#### Notes
Focus on creating robust, maintainable CloudWatch log group constructs that follow AWS CDK best practices. The log groups should support the structured logging patterns with correlation IDs as specified in the TRD document. Ensure consistent naming conventions and retention policies across all Lambda functions. The implementation should support the operational observability requirements and prepare for the metrics and dashboard implementation in the next ticket.
