# Ticket 1.3.3: Error Handling and Dead Letter Queue Setup

### Estimate
2 hours

**Status**: Refinement Complete

#### Description
Implement comprehensive error handling infrastructure for all 7 Lambda functions including dead letter queues, retry configurations, and error monitoring setup. This includes creating SQS dead letter queues for failed executions, configuring retry policies with exponential backoff, and establishing error handling patterns for the event-driven architecture.

#### Technical Details
- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. Create `lib/constructs/error-handling-construct.ts` for error handling infrastructure
  2. Implement `DeadLetterQueue` construct for failed Lambda executions
  3. Create SQS dead letter queues for each Lambda function
  4. Configure Lambda function retry policies with exponential backoff:
     - Base delay: 1-2 seconds
     - Maximum delay: 30 seconds
     - Maximum retries: 3 attempts
  5. Set up dead letter queue destinations for all Lambda functions
  6. Configure CloudWatch alarms for dead letter queue monitoring
  7. Implement error handling patterns for different failure scenarios
  8. Create error handling validation tests
  9. Set up error monitoring and alerting infrastructure

- **Architecture Considerations**:
  - Follow AWS best practices for dead letter queue implementation
  - Implement environment-based queue naming (dev/staging/prod)
  - Use modular error handling constructs for maintainable infrastructure
  - Ensure proper error isolation between functions
  - Establish foundation for operational monitoring

- **Security Requirements**:
  - Secure SQS queue configurations
  - Proper IAM permissions for dead letter queue access
  - Error message security and privacy protection
  - CloudWatch alarm security configuration

- **Performance Requirements**:
  - Dead letter queue creation time < 1 minute per queue
  - Retry policy configuration time < 30 seconds per function
  - Proper resource organization for efficient deployment

#### Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**:
  - Ticket 1.3.1: CDK Lambda Constructs and Basic Configuration
  - Ticket 1.3.2: IAM Roles and Policies Configuration
- **Dependent Tickets**:
  - Task 1.4: EventBridge Rules Configuration
  - Task 1.6: CloudWatch Monitoring Setup

#### Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**:
  - Dead letter queue creation validation tests
  - Retry policy configuration validation tests
  - Error handling pattern validation tests
  - Resource naming pattern validation
  - Security compliance validation

- **Integration Tests**:
  - Dead letter queue creation validation in development environment
  - Lambda function error handling validation
  - Retry policy testing with simulated failures
  - Environment-based naming validation
  - CloudWatch alarm configuration validation

- **Performance Tests**:
  - Dead letter queue creation performance validation
  - Retry policy configuration performance validation
  - Error handling performance validation

- **Security Tests**:
  - SQS queue security validation
  - IAM permission validation for error handling
  - CloudWatch alarm security validation
  - Error message privacy validation

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `lib/constructs/error-handling-construct.ts` created with error handling constructs
- [ ] SQS dead letter queues created for all 7 Lambda functions
- [ ] Retry policies configured with exponential backoff for all functions
- [ ] Dead letter queue destinations configured for all Lambda functions
- [ ] CloudWatch alarms configured for dead letter queue monitoring
- [ ] Error handling patterns implemented for different failure scenarios
- [ ] IAM permissions configured for dead letter queue access
- [ ] Environment-based queue naming conventions applied
- [ ] Error monitoring and alerting infrastructure established
- [ ] CDK synthesis completes successfully without errors
- [ ] All error handling infrastructure deploys successfully in development environment
- [ ] All unit tests pass with >90% coverage
- [ ] Dead letter queue creation time < 1 minute per queue
- [ ] Retry policy configuration time < 30 seconds per function

#### Error Handling
- Dead letter queue creation error handling and rollback
- Retry policy configuration error handling
- CloudWatch alarm configuration error handling
- CDK synthesis error handling and validation

#### Monitoring and Observability
- Dead letter queue creation performance metrics
- Retry policy configuration performance metrics
- Error handling validation logging
- CloudWatch alarm configuration logging

#### Open Questions
- None - all requirements are clear from the existing documentation

#### Notes
Focus on creating robust, maintainable error handling infrastructure that follows AWS best practices. The error handling should support the event-driven architecture and provide proper isolation between different failure scenarios. Ensure the dead letter queues are properly configured for monitoring and alerting, and that the retry policies align with the operational requirements defined in the TRD document. The implementation should prepare for the EventBridge rules configuration and CloudWatch monitoring setup in subsequent tasks.
