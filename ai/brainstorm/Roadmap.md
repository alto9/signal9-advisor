## Technical Architecture Highlights

### Event-Driven Data Processing
The system uses a sophisticated event-driven architecture with multiple scheduled triggers and event handlers:

**Scheduled Triggers (Cron Jobs)**:
- **4:00 AM**: Asset synchronization with Alpaca API (`/v2/assets?status=active`)
- **5:00 AM**: Earnings calendar synchronization with AlphaVantage
- **6:00 AM**: Earnings-triggered pollination (for assets with recent earnings)
- **7:00 AM**: Regular pollination (for high-volume, stale data assets)


**Event-Driven Processing**:
- **pollenationNeeded Events**: Trigger financial data ingestion for individual assets
- **analysisNeeded Events**: Trigger rule-based analysis generation for processed assets (batch processing of 8 assets)
- **earningsProcessed Events**: Mark earnings as processed to prevent duplicates
- **analysisComplete Events**: Signal completion of rule-based analysis workflow

### Smart Data Management
