## Technical Architecture Highlights

### Event-Driven Data Processing
The system uses a sophisticated event-driven architecture with multiple scheduled triggers and event handlers:

**Scheduled Triggers (Cron Jobs)**:
- **4:00 AM**: Asset synchronization with Alpaca API
- **5:00 AM**: Earnings calendar synchronization
- **6:00 AM**: Earnings-triggered pollination (for assets with recent earnings)
- **7:00 AM**: Regular pollination (for high-volume, stale data assets)

**Event-Driven Processing**:
- **pollenationNeeded Events**: Trigger financial data ingestion for individual assets
- **analysisNeeded Events**: Trigger AI analysis generation for processed assets
- **earningsProcessed Events**: Mark earnings as processed to prevent duplicates
- **analysisComplete Events**: Signal completion of AI analysis workflow

### Smart Data Management
- **Event-Driven Updates**: Individual asset processing triggered by specific events
- **Dual Pollination Paths**: Separate handling for regular updates vs. earnings-triggered updates
- **State Management**: Proper tracking of processed earnings to prevent duplicates
- **Rate Limit Optimization**: Efficient API usage with event-driven processing
- **Data Quality Validation**: Comprehensive validation at every processing stage

### Scalability Design
- **Event-Driven Processing**: Individual asset processing for optimal resource utilization
- **Auto-scaling**: DynamoDB and Lambda auto-scaling based on event volume
- **Event Management**: Event routing and handling with retry logic
- **Cost Optimization**: Resource monitoring and event-driven scaling

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Metrics
- System uptime >99.5%
