## Technical Architecture Overview
- **Architecture Pattern**: Event-driven serverless architecture with scheduled cron jobs and custom event processing
- **Key Technologies**: 
  - AWS Lambda (Node.js v22, TypeScript)
  - DynamoDB (on-demand billing)
  - EventBridge (scheduled rules and custom events)
  - CloudWatch (monitoring, metrics, alarms)
  - AWS CDK (infrastructure as code)
- **Integration Strategy**: RESTful API integration with external data providers, event-driven internal communication
- **Scalability Considerations**: On-demand DynamoDB scaling, bulk upsert operations for historical datasets, Lambda concurrency management

### **Scheduled Data Collection Workflow**
```
Monday-Saturday Schedule:
4:00 AM: Asset Sync (Alpaca API) → assets Table
5:00 AM: Earnings Calendar Sync (AlphaVantage API) → earningsCalendar Table
6:00 AM: Earnings-Triggered Pollination → pollenationNeeded Events for recent earnings
7:00 AM: Regular Pollination → pollenationNeeded Events for high-volume, stale assets
Hourly: News Sentiment Sync → newsSentiment Table with asset associations

Sunday: Maintenance Window (no scheduled jobs run)
```

### **Event-Driven Data Processing**
- **pollenationNeeded Events**: Trigger comprehensive financial data collection for specific assets (from both earnings and regular triggers)
- **earningsProcessed Events**: Mark earnings as processed to prevent duplicate collection
- **Dual Pollination Sources**: Events triggered by both earnings releases (6:00 AM) and regular data staleness checks (7:00 AM)
- **Bulk Historical Data Processing**: Each pollination re-processes complete historical datasets (typically 10+ years of financial data)

## Security and Compliance
- **Security Framework**: AWS IAM roles with minimal permissions, API credentials in Secrets Manager
- **Compliance Requirements**: Financial data handling compliance, no automated API key rotation initially
- **Data Protection**: Indefinite data retention for historical analysis, no PII processing

## Monitoring and Observability Strategy
- **Metrics Strategy**: 
  - Data collection success/failure rates
  - API response times and success rates
  - Lambda execution metrics and errors
  - DynamoDB read/write capacity and throttling
  - AlphaVantage rate limit tracking
- **Logging Strategy**: CloudWatch Logs for all Lambda functions, structured logging for debugging
- **Alerting Strategy**: CloudWatch alarms for critical failures, SNS notifications for system administrators
