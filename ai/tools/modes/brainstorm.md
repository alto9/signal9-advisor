# Brainstorming

## Behavior

- Help me brainstorm a project plan.
- Respond to questions with a variety of options when capable.
- When a decision is made, update all of the Brainstorm Documents to properly reflect the change in project structure.
- Use the Documents below to generate the plan structure.

## Brainstorming Specific Documents

- [ ] **PRD (Product Requirements Document)**: The [Product Requirements Document](/ai/brainstorm/PRD.md) should be populated based on the [PRD Format](/ai/tools/formats/PRD.md). This file should contain all of the details relevant to a product manager to define the overall project requirements from a product perspective.
- [ ] **TRD (Technical Requirements Document)**: The [Technical Requirements Document](/ai/brainstorm/TRD.md) should be populated based on the [TRD Format](ai/tools/formats/TRD.md). This file should contain all of the details relevant to a technical manager to define the overall project requirements from a technical perspective.
- [ ] **QRD (Quality Requirements Document)**: The [Quality Requirements Document](/ai/brainstorm/QRD.md) should be populated based on the [QRD Format](/ai/tools/formats/QRD.md). This file should contain all of the details relevant to a quality engineer to define the overall testing strategy, quality tools, and quality assurance requirements for the project.
- [ ] **CRD (Contextual Requirements Document)**: The [Contextual Requirements Document](/ai/brainstorm/CRD.md) should be populated based on the [CRD Format](ai/tools/formats/CRD.md). This file should contain all context details we have decided that we will need to fully define the project. API documents, MCP Tools, Web Pages, and internal documents should be considered at a minimum. As we brainstorm, add external references to the CRD file as needed.
- [ ] **Roadmap**: The [Roadmap](/ai/brainstorm/Roadmap.md) should be populated based on the [Roadmap Format](/ai/tools/formats/Roadmap.md). This file should contain the high level phases, and the goals of those phases. The full PRD, TRD, and QRD should be at all times represented in the Roadmap.

## Imperatives

- [ ] **Plan Cohesion**: Any change to any document in the following list should prompt analysis of the rest of the documents to make sure that together they form a cohesive project plan.
    - [Product Requirements Document](/ai/brainstorm/PRD.md)
    - [Technical Requirements Document](/ai/brainstorm/TRD.md)
    - [Quality Requirements Document](/ai/brainstorm/QRD.md)
    - [Context Requirements Document](/ai/brainstorm/CRD.md)
    - [Roadmap](/ai/brainstorm/Roadmap.md)
- [ ] **Open Questions**: Brainstorming is not considered completed until all open questions are resolved. All open questions which would prevent the project from being successfully planned should be listed in this file:
