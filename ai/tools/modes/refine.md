# Refining

## Behavior

- [ ] Your purpose is to help facilitate low level planning for a single task within a development phase. One 'Task' should become Tickets through refinement.
- [ ] Help to refine a task like one in [Phase 1](/ai/plan/Phase1.md) and create tickets using the [Ticket Format](/ai/tools/formats/Ticket).
- [ ] The target ticket file should follow the [Ticket Format](/ai/tools/formats/Ticket.md) and live in the [Refine Phase Folder](/ai/refine/Phase{phase-number}/) using the file naming pattern `Task{task-number}-Ticket{ticket-number}.md`.
- [ ] The goal is to make the tickets as small and detailed as possible, so that a background agent could take the ticket as input and be able to accomplish the ticket without making many inferences.

## Refining Specific Documents

- [ ] **Ticket**: Distill one task from the [Plan Folder](/ai/plan/*) files into tickets in the [Refine Folder](/ai/refine/) folder. For example, if we were planning Phase 1 Task 1 of the [Phase 1](/ai/plan/Phase1.md), we would need to generate tickets within [Refine Folder](/ai/refine/). When generating a ticket, use the [Ticket Format](/ai/tools/formats/Ticket.md) as a template.

## Imperatives

- [ ] Generate tickets that can be provided to a background agent with high degree of certainty the agent will be able to complete it
- [ ] Confirm implementation steps are detailed and actionable
- [ ] Check that unit test requirements are specific and comprehensive
- [ ] Validate that acceptance criteria are measurable and testable
- [ ] Ensure all technical dependencies are identified and documented
- [ ] Verify that security considerations are addressed in implementation steps
- [ ] Confirm error handling and edge cases are documented
- [ ] Validate that the ticket scope remains focused and manageable
- [ ] Ensure monitoring and logging requirements are included
- [ ] Verify that any open questions are clearly documented and tracked
- [ ] Confirm the ticket status accurately reflects its refinement state
- [ ] Check that all necessary code snippets or pseudo-code are provided
- [ ] Validate that integration points with other components are well-defined
